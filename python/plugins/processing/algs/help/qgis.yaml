qgis:distancematrix: >
  This algorithm creates a table containing a distance matrix, with distances between all the points in a points layer.

qgis:distancetonearesthublinetohub: >
  Given an origin and a destination layers, this algorithm computes the distance between origin features and their closest destination one. Distance calculations are based on the features center.

  The resulting layer contains lines linking each origin point with its nearest destination feature.

qgis:distancetonearesthubpoints: >
  Given an origin and a destination layers, this algorithm computes the distance between origin features and their closest destination one. Distance calculations are based on the features center.

  The resulting layer contains origin features center point with an additional field indicating the identifier of the nearest destination feature and the distance to it.

qgis:eliminateselectedpolygons: >
  This algorithm combines selected polygons of the input layer with certain adjacent polygons by erasing their common boundary. The adjacent polygon can be either the one with the largest or smallest area or the one sharing the largest common boundary with the polygon to be eliminated.
  Eliminate is normally used to get rid of sliver polygons, i.e. tiny polygons that are a result of polygon intersection processes where boundaries of the inputs are similar but not identical.

qgis:executesql: >
  Runs a simple or complex query with SQL syntax.

  Input data sources are identified with input1, input2, ..., inputN and a simple query will look like: SELECT * FROM input1

  The result of the query will be added as a new layer.

qgis:generatepointspixelcentroidsalongline: >
  This algorithm generates a point vector layer from an input raster and line layer.
  The points correspond to the pixel centroids that intersect the line layer.

qgis:hypsometriccurves: >
  This algorithm computes hypsometric curves  for an input Digital Elevation Model. Curves are produced as table files in an output folder specified by the user.

qgis:knearestconcavehull: >
  This algorithm generates a concave hull polygon from a set of points. If the input layer is a line or polygon layer, it will use the nodes.

  The number of neighbours to consider determines the concaveness of the output polygon. A lower number will result in a concave hull that follows the points very closely, while a higher number will have a smoother shape. The minimum number of neighbour points to consider is 3. A value equal to or greater than the number of points will result in a convex hull.

  If a field is selected, the algorithm will group the features in the input layer using unique values in that field and generate individual polygons in the output layer for each group.

qgis:linestopolygons: >
  This algorithm generates a polygon layer using as polygon rings the lines from an input line layer.

  The attribute table of the output layer is the same as the one from of the input line layer.

qgis:listuniquevalues: >
  This algorithm generates a report with information about the unique values found in a given attribute (or attributes) of a vector layer.

qgis:pointsdisplacement: >
  Offsets nearby point features by moving nearby points by a preset amount to minimize overlapping features.

qgis:polygonstolines: >
  This algorithm takes a polygon layer and creates a line layer, with lines representing the rings of the polygons in the input layer.

qgis:postgisexecuteandloadsql: >
  This algorithm performs a SQL database query on a PostGIS database connected to QGIS and loads the query results as a new layer.

qgis:randomextractwithinsubsets: >
  This algorithm takes a vector layer and generates a new one that contains only a subset of the features in the input layer.

  The subset is defined randomly, using a percentage or count value to define the total number of features in the subset.

  The percentage/count value is not applied to the whole layer, but instead to each category. Categories are defined according to a given attribute, which is also specified as an input parameter for the algorithm.

qgis:randompointsalongline: >
  This algorithm creates a point layer with a given "Number of points" placed on the lines of the "Input layer".

  The location of each point is determined by randomly selecting a feature, then a segment of the line geometry of that feature, and finally a random position on that segment. A minimum distance between the points can be specified (Euclidean distance).

qgis:randompointsinlayerbounds: >
  This algorithm creates a new point layer with a given number of random points, all of them within the extent of a given layer. A distance factor can be specified, to avoid points being too close to each other.

qgis:randompointsinsidepolygons: >
  This algorithm creates a new point layer with random points inside the polygons of a given layer.

  The number of points in each polygon can be defined as a fixed count or as a density value. The count/density value could also be taken from an attribute or an expression specified using the "Data defined override" functionality, so it can be different for each polygon in the input layer.

  A minimum distance can be specified, to avoid points being too close to each other.

qgis:randomselection: >
  This algorithm takes a vector layer and selects a subset of its features. No new layer is generated by this algorithm.

  The subset is defined randomly, using a percentage or count value to define the total number of features in the subset.

qgis:randomselectionwithinsubsets: >
  This algorithm takes a vector layer and selects a subset of its features. No new layer is generated by this algorithm.

  The subset is defined randomly, using a percentage or count value to define the total number of features in the subset.

  The percentage/count value is not applied to the whole layer, but instead to each category. Categories are defined according to a given attribute, which is also specified as an input parameter for the algorithm.

qgis:rastercalculator: >
  This algorithm allows performing algebraic operations using raster layers.

  The resulting layer will have its values computed according to an expression. The expression can contain numerical values, operators and references to any of the layers in the current project. The following functions are also supported:

  - sin(), cos(), tan(), atan2(), ln(), log10()

  The extent, cell size, and output CRS can be defined by the user. If the extent is not specified, the minimum extent that covers selected reference layer(s) will be used. If the cell size is not specified, the minimum cell size of selected reference layer(s) will be used. If the output CRS is not specified, the CRS of the first reference layer will be used.

  The cell size is assumed to be the same in both X and Y axes.

  Layers are referred by their name as displayed in the layer list and the number of the band to use (based on 1), using the pattern 'layer_name@band number'. For instance, the first band from a layer named DEM will be referred as DEM@1.

  When using the calculator in the batch interface or from the console, the files to use have to be specified. The corresponding layers are referred using the base name of the file (without the full path). For instance, if using a layer at path/to/my/rasterfile.tif, the first band of that layer will be referred as rasterfile.tif@1.

qgis:variabledistancebuffer: >
  This algorithm computes a buffer area for all the features in an input layer. The size of the buffer for a given feature is defined by an attribute, so it allows different features to have different buffer sizes.
