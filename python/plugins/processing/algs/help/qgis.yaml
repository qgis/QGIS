qgis:addfieldtoattributestable: >
  This algorithm adds a new attribute to a vector layer.

  The name and characteristics of the attribute are defined as parameters.

  The new attribute is not added to the input layer but a new layer is generated instead.

qgis:adduniquevalueindexfield: >
  This algorithm takes a vector layer and an attribute and adds a new numeric field. Values in this field correspond to values in the specified attribute, so features with the same value for the attribute will have the same value in the new numeric field. This creates a numeric equivalent of the specified attribute, which defines the same classes.

  The new attribute is not added to the input layer but a new layer is generated instead.

qgis:advancedpythonfieldcalculator: >
  This algorithm adds a new attribute to a vector layer, with values resulting from applying an expression to each feature. The expression is defined as a Python function.

qgis:aggregate: >
  This algorithm take a vector or table layer and aggregate features based on a group by expression. Features for which group by expression return the same value are grouped together.

  It is possible to group all source features together using constant value in group by parameter, example: NULL.

  It is also possible to group features using multiple fields using Array function, example: Array("Field1", "Field2").

  Geometries (if present) are combined into one multipart geometry for each group.

  Output attributes are computed depending on each given aggregate definition.

qgis:barplot:

qgis:basicstatisticsforfields: >
  This algorithm generates basic statistics from the analysis of a values in a field in the attribute table of a vector layer. Numeric, date, time and string fields are supported.

  The statistics returned will depend on the field type.

  Statistics are generated as an HTML file.

qgis:boundary: >
  Returns the closure of the combinatorial boundary of the input geometries (ie the topological boundary of the geometry). For instance, a polygon geometry will have a boundary consisting of the linestrings for each ring in the polygon. Only valid for polygon or line layers.

qgis:buildvirtualvector: >
  This algorithm creates a virtual layer that contains a set of vector layer.

  The output virtual layer will not be open in the current project.

qgis:centroids: >
  This algorithm creates a new point layer, with points representing the centroid of the geometries in an input layer.

  The attributes associated to each point in the output layer are the same ones associated to the original features.

qgis:checkvalidity: >
  This algorithm performs a validity check on the geometries of a vector layer.

  The geometries are classified in three groups (valid, invalid and error), and a vector layer is generated with the features in each of these categories.

qgis:clip: >
  This algorithm clips a vector layer using the polygons of an additional polygons layer. Only the parts of the features in the input layer that falls within the polygons of the clipping layer will be added to the resulting layer.

  The attributes of the features are not modified, although properties such as area or length of the features will be modified by the clipping operation. If such properties are stored as attributes, those attributes will have to be manually updated.

qgis:concavehull: >
  This algorithm computes the concave hull of the features in an input layer.

qgis:convertgeometrytype: >
  This algorithm generates a new layer based on an existing one, with a different type of geometry.

  Not all conversions are possible. For instance, a line layer can be converted to a point layer, but a point layer cannot be converted to a line layer.

  See the "Polygonize" or "Lines to polygons" algorithm for alternative options.

qgis:countpointsinpolygon: >
  This algorithm takes a points layer and a polygon layer and counts the number of points from the first one in each polygons of the second one.

  A new polygons layer is generated, with the exact same content as the input polygons layer, but containing an additional field with the points count corresponding to each polygon.

  An optional weight field can be used to assign weights to each point. If set, the count generated will be the sum of the weight field for each point contained by the polygon.

  Alternatively, a unique class field can be specified. If set, points are classified based on the selected attribute, and if several points with the same attribute value are within the polygon, only one of them is counted. The final count of the point in a polygon is, therefore, the count of different classes that are found in it.

  Both the weight field and unique class field cannot be specified. If they are, the weight field will take precedence and the unique class field will be ignored.

qgis:createattributeindex: >
  Creates an index to speed up queries made against a field in a table. Support for index creation is dependent on the layer's data provider and the field type.

qgis:createconstantrasterlayer: >
  Given an input raster layer and a value, this algorithm generates a new layer with the same extent and cell size as the input one, and all cells with the specified value.

qgis:creategridlines: >
  This algorithm creates a vector layer with a grid covering a given extent. Elements in the grid can be points, lines or polygons.

  The size and/or placement of each element in the grid is defined using a horizontal and vertical spacing.

  The CRS of the output layer must be defined. The grid extent and the spacing values must be expressed in the coordinates and units of this CRS.

  The top-left point (minX, maxY) is used as the reference point. That means that, at that point, an element is guaranteed to be placed. Unless the width and height of the selected extent is a multiple of the selected spacing, that is not true for the other points that define that extent.

qgis:createpointsalonglines: >
  This algorithm creates a points layer, with points distributed along the lines of an input vector layer. the distance between points (measured along the line) is defined as a parameter.

  Start and end points can be defined, so the first and last point do not fall on the line first and last node. Start and end points are defined as distances, measured from the first and last nodes of the lines, in the units of the projection used by the lines layer.

qgis:createspatialindex: >
  Creates an index to speed up access to the features in a layer based on their spatial location. Support for spatial index creation is dependent on the layer's data provider.

qgis:deletecolumn: >
  This algorithm takes a vector layer and generates a new one that has the exact same content but without the selected columns.

qgis:deleteduplicategeometries: >
  This algorithm finds duplicated geometries and removes them. Attributes are not checked, so in case two features have identical geometries but different attributes, only one of them will be added to the result layer.

qgis:deleteholes: >
  This algorithm takes a polygon layer and removes holes in polygons. It creates a new vector layer in which polygons with holes have been replaced by polygons with only their external ring. Attributes are not modified.

  An optional minimum area parameter allows removing only holes which are smaller than a specified area threshold. Leaving this parameter as 0.0 results in all holes being removed.

qgis:densifygeometries: >
  This algorithm takes a polygon or line layer and generates a new one in which the geometries have a larger number of vertices than the original one.

  If the geometries have z or m values present then these will be linearly interpolated at the added nodes.

  The number of new vertices to add to each feature geometry is specified as an input parameter.

qgis:densifygeometriesgivenaninterval: >
  This algorithm takes a polygon or line layer and generates a new one in which the geometries have a larger number of vertices than the original one. The geometries are densified by adding regularly placed extra nodes inside each segment so that the maximum distance between any two nodes does not exceed the specified distance.

  E.g. specifying a distance 3 would cause the segment [0 0] -> [10 0] to be converted to [0 0] -> [2.5 0] -> [5 0] -> [7.5 0] -> [10 0], since 3 extra nodes are required on the segment and spacing these at 2.5 increments allows them to be evenly spaced over the segment.

  If the geometries have z or m values present then these will be linearly interpolated at the added nodes.

  The distance is expressed in the same units used by the layer CRS.

qgis:dissolve: >
  This algorithm takes a polygon or line vector layer and combines their geometries into new geometries. One or more attributes can be specified to dissolve only geometries belonging to the same class (having the same value for the specified attributes), alternatively all geometries can be dissolved.

  If the geometries to be dissolved are spatially separated from each other the output will be multi geometries. In case the input is a polygon layer, common boundaries of adjacent polygons being dissolved will get erased.

qgis:distancematrix: >
  This algorithm creates a table containing a distance matrix, with distances between all the points in a points layer.

qgis:distancetonearesthub: >
  Given a layer with source point and another one representing destination points, this algorithm computes the distance between each source point and the closest destination one.

  The resulting layer can contain only source points with an additional field indicating the distance to the nearest point and the name of the destination point, or lines linking each source point with its nearest destination point.

qgis:eliminateselectedpolygons: >
  This algorithm combines selected polygons of the input layer with certain adjacent polygons by erasing their common boundary. The adjacent polygon can be either the one with the largest or smallest area or the one sharing the largest common boundary with the polygon to be eliminated.
  Eliminate is normally used to get rid of sliver polygons, i.e. tiny polygons that are a result of polygon intersection processes where boundaries of the inputs are similar but not identical.

qgis:exportaddgeometrycolumns: >
  This algorithm computes geometric properties of the features in a vector layer. It generates a new vector layer with the same content as the input one, but with additional attributes in its attributes table, containing geometric measurements.

  Depending on the geometry type of the vector layer, the attributes added to the table will be different.

qgis:extractbyexpression: >
  This algorithm creates a new vector layer that only contains matching features from an input layer. The criteria for adding features to the resulting layer is based on a QGIS expression.

  For more information about expressions see the <a href ="{qgisdocs}/user_manual/working_with_vector/expression.html">user manual</a>

qgis:extractspecificvertices: >
  This algorithm takes a line or polygon layer and generates a point layer with points representing specific vertices in the input lines or polygons. For instance, this algorithm can be used to extract the first or last vertices in the geometry. The attributes associated to each point are the same ones associated to the line or polygon that the point belongs to.

  The vertex indices parameter accepts a comma separated string specifying the indices of the vertices to extract. The first vertex corresponds to an index of 0, the second vertex has an index of 1, etc. Negative indices can be used to find vertices at the end of the geometry, e.g., an index of -1 corresponds to the last vertex, -2 corresponds to the second last vertex, etc.

  Additional fields are added to the points indicating the specific vertex position (e.g., 0, -1, etc), the original vertex index, the vertex’s part and its index within the part (as well as its ring for polygons), distance along the original geometry and bisector angle of vertex for the original geometry.

qgis:fieldcalculator: >
  This algorithm computes a new vector layer with the same features of the input layer, but with an additional attribute. The values of this new attribute are computed from each feature using a mathematical formula, based on the properties and attributes of the feature.

qgis:findprojection: >
  This algorithm allows creation of a shortlist of possible candidate coordinate reference systems for a layer with an unknown projection.

  The expected area which the layer should reside in must be specified via the target area parameter. Additionally, the coordinate reference system for this target area must also be set.

  The algorithm operates by testing the layer's extent in every known reference system and listing any in which the bounds would fall near the target area if the layer was in this projection.

qgis:fixeddistancebuffer: >
  This algorithm computes a buffer area for all the features in an input layer, using a fixed distance.

  The segments parameter controls the number of line segments to use to approximate a quarter circle when creating rounded offsets.

  The end cap style parameter controls how line endings are handled in the buffer.

  The join style parameter specifies whether round, miter or beveled joins should be used when offsetting corners in a line.

qgis:keepnbiggestparts: >
  This algorithm takes a polygon layer and creates a new polygon layer in which multipart geometries have been removed, leaving only the n largest (in terms of area) parts.

qgis:knearestconcavehull: >
  This algorithm generates a concave hull polygon from a set of points. If the input layer is a line or polygon layer, it will use the nodes.

  The number of neighbours to consider determines the concaveness of the output polygon. A lower number will result in a concave hull that follows the points very closely, while a higher number will have a smoother shape. The minimum number of neighbour points to consider is 3. A value equal to or greater than the number of points will result in a convex hull.

  If a field is selected, the algorithm will group the features in the input layer using unique values in that field and generate individual polygons in the output layer for each group.

qgis:lineintersections: >
  This algorithm creates point features where the lines in the Intersect layer intersect the lines in the Input layer.

  An ID field is specified for each of the input layers. Each point in the resulting layer will have the ID's of both input layers, allowing to identify them.

  The layers will all be reprojected to match the coordinate reference system of the first input layer.

qgis:minimumboundinggeometry: >
  This algorithm creates geometries which enclose the features from an input layer.

  Numerous enclosing geometry types are supported, including bounding boxes (envelopes), oriented rectangles, circles and convex hulls.

  Optionally, the features can be grouped by a field. If set, this causes the output layer to contain one feature per grouped value with a minimal geometry covering just the features with matching values.

qgis:multiparttosingleparts: >
  This algorithm takes a vector layer with multipart geometries and generates a new one in which all geometries contain a single part. Features with multipart geometries are divided in as many different features as parts the geometry contain, and the same attributes are used for each of them.

qgis:minimalenclosingcircle: >
  This algorithm takes a vector layer and generate a new one with the minimum enclosing circle that covers all the input features.

  As an alternative, the output layer can contain not just a single circle, but one for each input feature, representing the minimum enclosing circle that covers each of them.

qgis:orthogonalize: >
  This algorithm takes a line or polygon layer and attempts to orthogonalize all the geometries in the layer. This process shifts the nodes in the geometries to try to make every angle in the geometry either a right angle or a straight line.

  The angle tolerance parameter is used to specify the maximum deviation from a right angle or straight line a node can have for it to be adjusted. Smaller tolerances mean that only nodes which are already closer to right angles will be adjusted, and larger tolerances mean that nodes which deviate further from right angles will also be adjusted.

  The algorithm is iterative. Setting a larger number for the maximum iterations will result in a more orthogonal geometry at the cost of extra processing time.

qgis:pointsalonglines: >
  Creates points at regular intervals along line or polygon geometries. Created points will have new attributes added for the distance along the geometry and the angle of the line at the point.

  An optional start and end offset can be specified, which controls how far from the start and end of the geometry the points should be created.

qgis:pointsdisplacement:
  Offsets nearby point features by moving nearby points by a preset amount to minimize overlapping features.

qgis:pointslayerfromtable: >
  This algorithm generates a points layer based on the values from an input table.

  The table must contain a field with the X coordinate of each point and another one with the Y coordinate. A CRS for the output layer has to be specified, and the coordinates in the table are assumed to be expressed in the units used by that CRS.

  The attributes table of the resulting layer will be the input table.

qgis:pointstopath:
  Converts a point layer to a line layer, by joining points in a defined order.

  Points can be grouped by a field to output individual line features per group.

qgis:polarplot: >
  This algorithm generates a polar plot based on the value of an input vector layer.

  Two fields must be entered as parameters: one that define the category (to group features) and another one with the variable to plot (this has to be a numeric one)

qgis:poleofinaccessibility: >
  This algorithm calculates the pole of inaccessibility for a polygon layer, which is the most distant internal point from the boundary of the surface. This algorithm uses the 'polylabel' algorithm (Vladimir Agafonkin, 2016), which is an iterative approach guaranteed to find the true pole of inaccessibility within a specified tolerance (in layer units). More precise tolerances require more iterations and will take longer to calculate.

  The distance from the calculated pole to the polygon boundary will be stored as a new attribute in the output layer.

qgis:polygoncentroids: >
  This algorithm creates a new point layer, with points representing the centroid of polygons of an input layer.

  The attributes associated to each point in the output layer are the same ones associated to the original polygon.

  NOTE: This algorithm is deprecated and the generic "centroids" algorithm (which works for line and multi geometry layers) should be used instead.

qgis:randompointsinsidepolygonsvariable: >
  This algorithm creates a new point layer with random points inside the polygons of a given layer. The number of points in each polygon can be defined as a fixed count or as a density value.

qgis:rastercalculator: >
  This algorithm allows performing algebraic operations using raster layers.

  The resulting layer will have its values computed according to an expression. The expression can contain numerical values, operators and references to any of the layers in the current project. The following functions are also supported:

  - sin(), cos(), tan(), atan2(), ln(), log10()

  The extent, cell size, and output CRS can be defined by the user. If the extent is not specified, the minimum extent that covers selected reference layer(s) will be used. If the cell size is not specified, the minimum cell size of selected reference layer(s) will be used. If the output CRS is not specified, the CRS of the first reference layer will be used.

  The cell size is assumed to be the same in both X and Y axes.

  Layers are referred by their name as displayed in the layer list and the number of the band to use (based on 1), using the pattern 'layer_name@band number'. For instance, the first band from a layer named DEM will be referred as DEM@1.

  When using the calculator in the batch interface or from the console, the files to use have to be specified. The corresponding layers are referred using the base name of the file (without the full path). For instance, if using a layer at path/to/my/rasterfile.tif, the first band of that layer will be referred as rasterfile.tif@1.

  For more information about expressions see the <a href ="{qgisdocs}/user_manual/working_with_vector/expression.html">user manual</a>

qgis:setmvalue: >

  This algorithm buffers lines by a specified distance on one side of the line only.

  The segments parameter controls the number of line segments to use to approximate a quarter circle when creating rounded buffers.

  The join style parameter specifies whether round, miter or beveled joins should be used when buffering corners in a line.

  The miter limit parameter is only applicable for miter join styles, and controls the maximum distance from the buffer to use when creating a mitered join.

qgis:snapgeometries: >
  This algorithm snaps the geometries in a layer. Snapping can be done either to the geometries from another layer, or to geometries within the same layer.

  A tolerance is specified in layer units to control how close vertices need to be to the reference layer geometries before they are snapped.

qgis:statisticsbycategories:


qgis:sumlinelengths: >
  This algorithm takes a polygon layer and a line layer and measures the total length of lines and the total number of them that cross each polygon.

  The resulting layer has the same features as the input polygon layer, but with two additional attributes containing the length and count of the lines across each polygon. The names of these two fields can be configured in the algorithm parameters.

qgis:texttofloat: >
  This algorithm modifies the type of a given attribute in a vector layer, converting a text attribute containing numeric strings into a numeric attribute.

qgis:topologicalcoloring: >
  This algorithm assigns a color index to polygon features in such a way that no adjacent polygons share the same color index, whilst minimizing the number of colors required.

  An optional minimum distance between features assigned the same color can be set to prevent nearby (but non-touching) features from being assigned equal colors.

  The algorithm allows choice of method to use when assigning colors. The default method attempts to assign colors so that the count of features assigned to each individual color index is balanced.

  The 'by assigned area' mode instead assigns colors so that the total area of features assigned to each color is balanced. This mode can be useful to help avoid large features resulting in one of the colors appearing more dominant on a colored map.

  The 'by distance between colors' mode will assign colors in order to maximize the distance between features of the same color. This mode helps to create a more uniform distribution of colors across a map.

  A minimum number of colors can be specified if desired. The color index is saved to a new attribute named color_id.

qgis:translate: >
  This algorithm moves the geometries within a layer, by offsetting them with a specified x and y displacement.

  For shapefile datasets, the .prj and .qpj files will be overwritten - or created if missing - to match the provided CRS.
