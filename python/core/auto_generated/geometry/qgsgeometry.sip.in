class QgsGeometry
{
%Docstring(signature="appended")
A geometry is the spatial representation of a feature.

:py:class:`QgsGeometry` acts as a generic container for geometry objects. :py:class:`QgsGeometry` objects are implicitly shared,
so making copies of geometries is inexpensive. The geometry container class can also be stored inside
a QVariant object.

The actual geometry representation is stored as a :py:class:`QgsAbstractGeometry` within the container, and
can be accessed via the :py:func:`~get` method or set using the :py:func:`~set` method. This gives access to the underlying
raw geometry primitive, such as the point, line, polygon, curve or other geometry subclasses.

.. note::

   :py:class:`QgsGeometry` objects are inherently Cartesian/planar geometries. They have no concept of geodesy, and none
   of the methods or properties exposed from the :py:class:`QgsGeometry` API (or :py:class:`QgsAbstractGeometry` subclasses) utilize
   geodesic calculations. Accordingly, properties like :py:func:`~length` and :py:func:`~area` or spatial operations like :py:func:`~buffer`
   are always calculated using strictly Cartesian mathematics. In contrast, the :py:class:`QgsDistanceArea` class exposes
   methods for working with geodesic calculations and spatial operations on geometries,
   and should be used whenever calculations which account for the curvature of the Earth (or any other celestial body)
   are required.

Creates a wedge shaped buffer from a ``center`` point.

The ``azimuth`` gives the angle (in degrees) for the middle of the wedge to point.
The buffer width (in degrees) is specified by the ``angularWidth`` parameter. Note that the
wedge will extend to half of the ``angularWidth`` either side of the ``azimuth`` direction.

The outer radius of the buffer is specified via ``outerRadius``, and optionally an
``innerRadius`` can also be specified.

The returned geometry will be a CurvePolygon geometry containing circular strings. It may
need to be segmentized to convert to a standard Polygon geometry.

    bool equals( const QgsGeometry &geometry ) const;
%Docstring
Test if this geometry is exactly equal to another ``geometry``.

This is a strict equality check, where the underlying geometries must
have exactly the same type, component vertices and vertex order.

Calling this method is dramatically faster than the topological
equality test performed by :py:func:`~QgsGeometry.isGeosEqual`.

.. note::

   Comparing two null geometries will return ``False``.

.. versionadded:: 1.5
%End

    bool isGeosEqual( const QgsGeometry & ) const;
%Docstring
Compares the geometry with another geometry using GEOS.

This method performs a slow, topological check, where geometries
are considered equal if all of the their component edges overlap. E.g.
lines with the same vertex locations but opposite direction will be
considered equal by this method.

Consider using the much faster, stricter equality test performed
by :py:func:`~QgsGeometry.equals` instead.

    bool isSimple() const;
%Docstring
Determines whether the geometry is simple (according to OGC definition),
i.e. it has no anomalous geometric points, such as self-intersection or self-tangency.
Uses GEOS library for the test.

.. note::

   This is useful mainly for linestrings and linear rings. Polygons are simple by definition,
   for checking anomalies in polygon geometries one can use :py:func:`~QgsGeometry.isGeosValid`.

.. versionadded:: 3.0
%End

    bool isAxisParallelRectangle( double maximumDeviation, bool simpleRectanglesOnly = false ) const;
%Docstring
Returns ``True`` if the geometry is a polygon that is almost an axis-parallel rectangle.

The ``maximumDeviation`` argument specifes the maximum angle (in degrees) that the polygon edges
are allowed to deviate from axis parallel lines.

By default the check will permit polygons with more than 4 edges, so long as the overall shape of
the polygon is an axis-parallel rectangle (i.e. it is tolerant to rectangles with additional vertices
added along the rectangle sides). If ``simpleRectanglesOnly`` is set to ``True`` then the method will
only return ``True`` if the geometry is a simple rectangle consisting of 4 edges.

    QgsVertexIterator vertices() const;
%Docstring
Returns a read-only, Java-style iterator for traversal of vertices of all the geometry, including all geometry parts and rings.

.. warning::

   The iterator returns a copy of individual vertices, and accordingly geometries cannot be
   modified using the iterator. See :py:func:`~QgsGeometry.transformVertices` for a safe method to modify vertices "in-place".

Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

       # print the x and y coordinate for each vertex in a LineString
       geometry = QgsGeometry.fromWkt( 'LineString( 0 0, 1 1, 2 2)' )

.. versionadded:: 3.0
%End


    QgsGeometryPartIterator parts();
%Docstring
Returns Java-style iterator for traversal of parts of the geometry. This iterator
can safely be used to modify parts of the geometry.

This method forces a detach. Use :py:func:`~QgsGeometry.constParts` to avoid the detach
if the parts are not going to be modified.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

       # print the WKT representation of each part in a multi-point geometry
       geometry = QgsGeometry.fromWkt( 'MultiPoint( 0 0, 1 1, 2 2)' )
       for part in geometry.parts():
           print(part.asWkt())

       # single part geometries only have one part - this loop will iterate once only
       geometry = QgsGeometry.fromWkt( 'LineString( 0 0, 10 10 )' )
       for part in geometry.parts():
           print(part.asWkt())

       # parts can be modified during the iteration
       geometry = QgsGeometry.fromWkt( 'MultiPoint( 0 0, 1 1, 2 2)' )
       for part in geometry.parts():
           part.transform(ct)

       # part iteration can also be combined with vertex iteration
       geometry = QgsGeometry.fromWkt( 'MultiPolygon((( 0 0, 0 10, 10 10, 10 0, 0 0 ),( 5 5, 5 6, 6 6, 6 5, 5 5)),((20 2, 22 2, 22 4, 20 4, 20 2)))' )

    QgsGeometryConstPartIterator constParts() const;
%Docstring
Returns Java-style iterator for traversal of parts of the geometry. This iterator
returns read-only references to parts and cannot be used to modify the parts.

Unlike :py:func:`~QgsGeometry.parts`, this method does not force a detach and is more efficient if read-only
iteration only is required.

Example

    double hausdorffDistance( const QgsGeometry &geom ) const;
%Docstring
Returns the Hausdorff distance between this geometry and ``geom``. This is basically a measure of how similar or dissimilar 2 geometries are.

This algorithm is an approximation to the standard Hausdorff distance. This approximation is exact or close enough for a large
subset of useful cases. Examples of these are:

- computing distance between Linestrings that are roughly parallel to each other,
  and roughly equal in length. This occurs in matching linear networks.
- Testing similarity of geometries.

If the default approximate provided by this method is insufficient, use :py:func:`~QgsGeometry.hausdorffDistanceDensify` instead.

In case of error -1 will be returned.

    double hausdorffDistanceDensify( const QgsGeometry &geom, double densifyFraction ) const;
%Docstring
Returns the Hausdorff distance between this geometry and ``geom``. This is basically a measure of how similar or dissimilar 2 geometries are.

This function accepts a ``densifyFraction`` argument. The function performs a segment
densification before computing the discrete Hausdorff distance. The ``densifyFraction`` parameter
sets the fraction by which to densify each segment. Each segment will be split into a
number of equal-length subsegments, whose fraction of the total length is
closest to the given fraction.

This method can be used when the default approximation provided by :py:func:`~QgsGeometry.hausdorffDistance`
is not sufficient. Decreasing the ``densifyFraction`` parameter will make the
distance returned approach the true Hausdorff distance for the geometries.

In case of error -1 will be returned.

    double frechetDistance( const QgsGeometry &geom ) const throw( QgsNotSupportedException );

Returns the Fréchet distance between this geometry and ``geom``, restricted to discrete points for both geometries.

The Fréchet distance is a measure of similarity between curves that takes into account the location and ordering of the points along the curves.
Therefore it is often better than the Hausdorff distance.

In case of error -1 will be returned.

This method requires a QGIS build based on GEOS 3.7 or later.

Removes duplicate nodes from the geometry, wherever removing the nodes does not result in a

The ``epsilon`` parameter specifies the tolerance for coordinates when determining that
vertices are identical.

By default, z values are not considered when detecting duplicate nodes. E.g. two nodes
with the same x and y coordinate but different z values will still be considered
duplicate and one will be removed. If ``useZValues`` is ``True``, then the z values are
also tested and nodes with the same x and y but different z will be maintained.

Note that duplicate nodes are not tested between different parts of a multipart geometry. E.g.
a multipoint geometry with overlapping points will not be changed by this method.

The function will return ``True`` if nodes were removed, or ``False`` if no duplicate nodes
were found.

    QgsGeometry densifyByDistance( double distance ) const;
%Docstring
Densifies the geometry by adding regularly placed extra nodes inside each segment
so that the maximum distance between any two nodes does not exceed the
specified ``distance``.
E.g. specifying a distance 3 would cause the segment [0 0] -> [10 0]
to be converted to [0 0] -> [2.5 0] -> [5 0] -> [7.5 0] -> [10 0], since
3 extra nodes are required on the segment and spacing these at 2.5 increments
allows them to be evenly spaced over the segment.
If the geometry has z or m values present then these will be linearly interpolated
at the added nodes.
Curved geometry types are automatically segmentized by this routine.

    QgsGeometry convertToCurves( double distanceTolerance = 1e-8, double angleTolerance = 1e-8 ) const;
%Docstring
Attempts to convert a non-curved geometry into a curved geometry type (e.g.
LineString to CompoundCurve, Polygon to CurvePolygon).

The ``distanceTolerance`` specifies the maximum deviation allowed between the original location
of vertices and where they would fall on the candidate curved geometry.

This method only consider a segments as suitable for replacing with an arc if the points are all
regularly spaced on the candidate arc. The ``pointSpacingAngleTolerance`` parameter specifies the maximum
angular deviation (in radians) allowed when testing for regular point spacing.

Calculates the approximate pole of inaccessibility for a surface, which is the
most distant internal point from the boundary of the surface. This function
uses the 'polylabel' algorithm (Vladimir Agafonkin, 2016), which is an iterative
approach guaranteed to find the true pole of inaccessibility within a specified
tolerance. More precise tolerances require more iterations and will take longer
to calculate.

    QgsGeometry largestEmptyCircle( double tolerance, const QgsGeometry &boundary = QgsGeometry() ) const throw( QgsNotSupportedException );
%Docstring
Constructs the Largest Empty Circle for a set of obstacle geometries, up to a
specified tolerance.

The Largest Empty Circle is the largest circle which has its center in the convex hull of the
obstacles (the boundary), and whose interior does not intersect with any obstacle.
The circle center is the point in the interior of the boundary which has the farthest distance from
the obstacles (up to tolerance). The circle is determined by the center point and a point lying on an
obstacle indicating the circle radius.
The implementation uses a successive-approximation technique over a grid of square cells covering the obstacles and boundary.
The grid is refined using a branch-and-bound algorithm.  Point containment and distance are computed in a performant
way by using spatial indexes.
Returns a two-point linestring, with one point at the center of the inscribed circle and the other
on the boundary of the inscribed circle.

This method requires QGIS builds based on GEOS 3.9 or later.

%Docstring
Returns a linestring geometry which represents the minimum diameter of the geometry.

The minimum diameter is defined to be the width of the smallest band that
contains the geometry, where a band is a strip of the plane defined
by two parallel lines. This can be thought of as the smallest hole that the geometry
can be moved through, with a single rotation.

    double minimumClearance() const throw( QgsNotSupportedException );
%Docstring
Computes the minimum clearance of a geometry.

The minimum clearance is the smallest amount by which
a vertex could be moved to produce an invalid polygon, a non-simple linestring, or a multipoint with
repeated points.  If a geometry has a minimum clearance of 'eps', it can be said that:

- No two distinct vertices in the geometry are separated by less than 'eps'
- No vertex is closer than 'eps' to a line segment of which it is not an endpoint.

If the minimum clearance cannot be defined for a geometry (such as with a single point, or a multipoint
whose points are identical) a value of infinity will be returned.

If an error occurs while calculating the clearance NaN will be returned.

This method requires a QGIS build based on GEOS 3.6 or later.

Creates a Voronoi diagram for the nodes contained within the geometry.

Returns the Voronoi polygons for the nodes contained within the geometry.
If ``extent`` is specified then it will be used as a clipping envelope for the diagram.
If no extent is set then the clipping envelope will be automatically calculated.
In either case the diagram will be clipped to the larger of the provided envelope
OR the envelope surrounding all input nodes.
The ``tolerance`` parameter specifies an optional snapping tolerance which can
be used to improve the robustness of the diagram calculation.

    QgsGeometry subdivide( int maxNodes = 256 ) const;
%Docstring
Subdivides the geometry. The returned geometry will be a collection containing subdivided parts
from the original geometry, where no part has more then the specified maximum number of nodes (``maxNodes``).

This is useful for dividing a complex geometry into less complex parts, which are better able to be spatially
indexed and faster to perform further operations such as intersects on. The returned geometry parts may
not be valid and may contain self-intersections.

The minimum allowed value for ``maxNodes`` is 8.

Curved geometries will be segmentized before subdivision.

Attempts to coerce this geometry into the specified destination ``type``.

This method will do anything possible to force the current geometry into the specified type. E.g.

- lines or polygons will be converted to points by return either a single multipoint geometry or multiple
  single point geometries.
- polygons will be converted to lines by extracting their exterior and interior rings, returning
  either a multilinestring or multiple single line strings as dictated by ``type``.
- lines will be converted to polygon rings if ``type`` is a polygon type
- curved geometries will be segmented if ``type`` is non-curved.
- multi geometries will be converted to a list of single geometries
- single geometries will be upgraded to multi geometries
- z or m values will be added or dropped as required.

Since QGIS 3.24, the parameters ``defaultZ`` and ``defaultM`` control the dimension value added when promoting geometries
to Z, M or ZM versions.
By default 0.0 is used for Z and M.

   This method is much stricter than :py:func:`~QgsGeometry.convertToType`, as it considers the exact WKB type

Attempts to make an invalid geometry valid without losing vertices.

Already-valid geometries are returned without further intervention.
In case of full or partial dimensional collapses, the output geometry may be a collection
of lower-to-equal dimension geometries or a geometry of lower dimension.
Single polygons may become multi-geometries in case of self-intersections.
It preserves Z values, but M values will be dropped.

If an error was encountered during the process, more information can be retrieved
by calling :py:func:`~QgsGeometry.lastError` on the returned geometry.

:return: new valid QgsGeometry or null geometry on error

.. note::

   For QGIS builds using GEOS library versions older than 3.8 this method calls
   an internal fork of PostGIS' ST_MakeValid() function. For builds based on GEOS 3.8 or
   later this method calls the GEOS MakeValid method directly.

    static QgsGeometryEngine *createGeometryEngine( const QgsAbstractGeometry *geometry ) /Factory/;
%Docstring
Creates and returns a new geometry engine representing the specified ``geometry``.

A geometry engine is a low-level representation of a :py:class:`QgsAbstractGeometry` object, optimised for use with external
geometry libraries such as GEOS.

:py:class:`QgsGeometryEngine` objects provide a mechanism for optimized evaluation of geometric algorithms, including spatial relationships
between geometries and operations such as buffers or clipping. :py:class:`QgsGeometryEngine` is recommended for use in any
performance critical code instead of directly using the equivalent QgsGeometry methods such as :py:func:`QgsGeometry.intersects()`.

Many methods available in the :py:class:`QgsGeometryEngine` class can benefit from pre-preparing geometries. For instance, whenever
a large number of spatial relationships will be tested (such as calling :py:func:`~QgsGeometry.intersects`, :py:func:`~QgsGeometry.within`, etc) then the
geometry should first be prepared by calling :py:func:`~QgsGeometry.prepareGeometry` before performing the tests.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

       # polygon_geometry contains a complex polygon, with many vertices
       polygon_geometry = QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Polygon((...))')

       # create a QgsGeometryEngine representation of the polygon
       polygon_geometry_engine = QgsGeometry.createGeometryEngine(polygon_geometry.constGet())

       # since we'll be performing many intersects tests, we can speed up these tests considerably
       # by first "preparing" the geometry engine
       polygon_geometry_engine.prepareGeometry()

       # now we are ready to quickly test intersection against many other objects
       for feature in my_layer.getFeatures():
           feature_geometry = feature.geometry()
           # test whether the feature's geometry intersects our original complex polygon
           if polygon_geometry_engine.intersects(feature_geometry.constGet()):
               print('feature intersects the polygon!')

:py:class:`QgsGeometryEngine` operations are backed by the GEOS library (https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/).
