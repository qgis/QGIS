class QgsEllipse
{
%Docstring(signature="appended")
Ellipse geometry type.

An ellipse is defined by a center point with a semi-major axis, a
semi-minor axis and an azimuth. The azimuth is the north angle to the
first quadrant (always oriented on the semi-major axis), in degrees. By
default, the semi-major axis is oriented to the east (90 degrees). The
semi-minor axis is always smaller than the semi-major axis. If it is set
larger, it will be swapped and the azimuth will increase by 90 degrees.

  public:

    QgsEllipse() /HoldGIL/;
%Docstring
Constructor for QgsEllipse.
%End

    virtual ~QgsEllipse();

    QgsEllipse( const QgsPoint &center, double semiMajorAxis, double semiMinorAxis, double azimuth = 90 ) /HoldGIL/;
%Docstring
Constructs an ellipse by defining all the members.

:param center: The center of the ellipse.
:param semiMajorAxis: Semi-major axis of the ellipse.
:param semiMinorAxis: Semi-minor axis of the ellipse.
:param azimuth: Angle in degrees started from the North to the first
                quadrant.
%End

    static QgsEllipse fromFoci( const QgsPoint &pt1, const QgsPoint &pt2, const QgsPoint &pt3 ) /HoldGIL/;
%Docstring
Constructs an ellipse by foci (``pt1`` and ``pt2``) and a point ``pt3``.
The center point can have m value which is the result from the midpoint
operation between ``pt1`` and ``pt2``. Z dimension is also supported and
is retrieved from the first 3D point amongst ``pt1`` and ``pt2``. Axes
are calculated from the 2D distance with the third point ``pt3``. The
azimuth is the angle between ``pt1`` and ``pt2``.

:param pt1: First focus.
:param pt2: Second focus.
:param pt3: A point to calculate the axes.
%End

    static QgsEllipse fromExtent( const QgsPoint &pt1, const QgsPoint &pt2 ) /HoldGIL/;
%Docstring
Constructs an ellipse by an extent (aka bounding box /
:py:class:`QgsRectangle`). The center point can have m value which is
the result from the midpoint operation between ``pt1`` and ``pt2``. Z
dimension is also supported and is retrieved from the first 3D point
amongst ``pt1`` and ``pt2``. Axes are calculated from the 2D distance
between ``pt1`` and ``pt2``. The azimuth always takes the default value.

:param pt1: First corner.
:param pt2: Second corner.
%End

    static QgsEllipse fromCenterPoint( const QgsPoint &ptc, const QgsPoint &pt1 ) /HoldGIL/;
%Docstring
Constructs an ellipse by a center point and a another point. The center
point keeps m value from ``ptc``. Z dimension is also supported and is
retrieved from the first 3D point amongst ``ptc`` and ``pt1``. Axes are
calculated from the 2D distance between ``ptc`` and ``pt1``. The azimuth
always takes the default value.

:param ptc: Center point.
:param pt1: First point.
%End

    static QgsEllipse fromCenter2Points( const QgsPoint &ptc, const QgsPoint &pt1, const QgsPoint &pt2 ) /HoldGIL/;
%Docstring
Constructs an ellipse by a central point and two other points. The
center point keeps m value from ``ptc``. Z dimension is also supported
and is retrieved from the first 3D point amongst ``ptc``, ``pt1`` and
``pt2``. Axes are calculated from the 2D distance between ``ptc`` and
``pt1`` and ``pt2``. The azimuth is the angle between ``ptc`` and
``pt1``.

:param ptc: Center point.
:param pt1: First point.
:param pt2: Second point.
%End

    static QgsEllipse from4Points( const QgsPoint &pt1, const QgsPoint &pt2, const QgsPoint &pt3, const QgsPoint &pt4 ) /HoldGIL/;
%Docstring
Constructs an ellipse from 4 points.

The ellipse will have axes aligned to the X and Y axes. The 4 points
must lie on the ellipse and define a unique axis-aligned ellipse.

Z dimension is supported and is retrieved from the first 3D point
amongst the input points. M value is retrieved from the first point with
M amongst the input points.

If the 4 points do not define a valid ellipse (e.g., collinear points,
points forming a hyperbola, or insufficient points), an empty ellipse is
returned.

:param pt1: First point on the ellipse.
:param pt2: Second point on the ellipse.
:param pt3: Third point on the ellipse.
:param pt4: Fourth point on the ellipse.

:return: The constructed ellipse, or an empty ellipse if the points do
         not define a valid ellipse.

.. note::

   This method produces only axis-aligned ellipses (azimuth is always 90 degrees).

.. versionadded:: 4.0
%End

    static QgsEllipse fromCenter3Points( const QgsPoint &center, const QgsPoint &pt1, const QgsPoint &pt2, const QgsPoint &pt3 ) /HoldGIL/;
%Docstring
Constructs an ellipse from a center point and 3 points on the ellipse.

Unlike :py:func:`~QgsEllipse.from4Points`, this method can produce
ellipses with any orientation.

Z dimension is supported and is retrieved from the first 3D point
amongst the input points. M value is retrieved from the first point with
M amongst the input points.

If ``pt2`` and ``pt3`` are identical (within tolerance), the method will
construct an axis-aligned ellipse using only 2 points.

If the points do not define a valid ellipse (e.g., a point coincides
with the center, points are collinear through the center, or the
resulting shape is not an ellipse), an empty ellipse is returned.

:param center: The center point of the ellipse.
:param pt1: First point on the ellipse.
:param pt2: Second point on the ellipse.
:param pt3: Third point on the ellipse.

:return: The constructed ellipse, or an empty ellipse if the points do
         not define a valid ellipse.
