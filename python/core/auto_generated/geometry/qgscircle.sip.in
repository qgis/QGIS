A circle is defined by a center point with a radius and an azimuth.
The azimuth is the north angle to the semi-major axis, in degrees. By default, the semi-major axis is oriented to the north (0 degrees).

%Docstring
Returns an array of circle constructed by 3 tangents on the circle (aka inscribed circle of a triangle).

- 1: The three tangents make a triangle or when two tangents are parallel there are two possible circles (see examples).
  If pos is not an empty point, we use its coordinates to determine which circle will be returned.
  More precisely the circle that will be returned will be the one whose center is on the same side as pos relative to the third tangent.

the z value of the circle intersections.

    static int calculateSegmentsStandard( double radius, double tolerance, int minSegments );
%Docstring
Calculate the number of segments needed to approximate a circle within a given tolerance.

This function uses the sagitta (geometric chord height) to determine the number of segments
required to approximate a circle such that the maximum deviation between the circle and its
polygonal approximation is less than the specified tolerance.

Mathematical approach:
1. Using the sagitta formula: s = r(1 - cos(θ/2))
where s is the sagitta, r is the radius, and θ is the segment angle
2. Substituting tolerance for s:
tolerance = radius(1 - cos(θ/2))
3. Solving for θ:
tolerance/radius = 1 - cos(θ/2)
cos(θ/2) = 1 - tolerance/radius
θ/2 = arccos(1 - tolerance/radius)
θ = 2 * arccos(1 - tolerance/radius)
4. Number of segments = ceil(2π / θ)
= ceil(π / arccos(1 - tolerance/radius))

:param radius: The radius of the circle to approximate
:param tolerance: Maximum allowed deviation between the circle and its polygonal approximation
:param minSegments: Minimum number of segments to use, regardless of the calculated value

:return: The number of segments needed

.. note::

   This is a private helper method
%End

    static int calculateSegmentsAdaptive( double radius, double tolerance, int minSegments );
%Docstring
Calculate the number of segments with adaptive tolerance based on radius.

This method extends :py:func:`~QgsCircle.calculateSegments` by using an adaptive tolerance that scales
with the radius to maintain better visual quality. While :py:func:`~QgsCircle.calculateSegments` uses
a fixed tolerance, this version adjusts the tolerance based on the radius size.

Mathematical approach:
1. Compute adaptive tolerance that varies with radius:
adaptive_tolerance = base_tolerance * sqrt(radius) / log10(radius + 1)

For small radii: tolerance decreases → more segments for better detail
For large radii: tolerance increases gradually → fewer segments needed
sqrt(radius) provides basic scaling
log10(radius + 1) dampens the scaling for large radii

2. Apply sagitta-based calculation:

Calculate angle = 2 * arccos(1 - adaptive_tolerance/radius)
Number of segments = ceil(2π/angle)

This adaptation ensures:

Small circles get more segments for better visual quality
Large circles don't get excessive segments
Smooth transition between different scales

:param radius: The radius of the circle to approximate
:param tolerance: Base tolerance value that will be scaled
:param minSegments: Minimum number of segments to use

:return: The number of segments needed

.. note::

   This is a private helper method
%End

    static int calculateSegmentsByAreaError( double radius, double baseTolerance, int minSegments );
%Docstring
Calculate the number of segments based on the maximum allowed area error.

This function computes the minimum number of segments needed to approximate
a circle with a regular polygon such that the relative area error between
the polygonal approximation and the actual circle is less than the specified tolerance.

Mathematical derivation:
1. Area ratio between a regular n-sided polygon and a circle:
Circle area: Ac = πr²
Regular polygon area: Ap = (nr²/2) * sin(2π/n)
Ratio = Ap / Ac = (n / 2π) * sin(2π/n)

2. For relative error E:
E = |1 - Ap / Ac| = |1 - (n / 2π) * sin(2π/n)|

3. Using Taylor series approximation for sin(x) when x is small:
sin(x) ≈ x - x³ / 6
With x = 2π / n:
sin(2π / n) ≈ (2π / n) - (2π / n)³ / 6

4. Substituting and simplifying:
E ≈ |1 - (n / 2π) * ((2π / n) - (2π / n)³ / 6)|
E ≈ |1 - (1 - (2π² / 3n²))|
E ≈ 2π² / 3n²

5. Rearranging to find the minimum n for a given tolerance:
Start with the inequality: E ≤ tolerance
Substitute the expression for E:
2π² / 3n² ≤ tolerance
Rearrange to isolate n²:
n² ≥ 2π² / (3 * tolerance)
Taking the square root:
n ≥ π * sqrt(2 / (3 * tolerance))

:param radius: The radius of the circle to approximate
:param baseTolerance: Maximum acceptable area error in percentage
:param minSegments: The minimum number of segments to use

:return: The number of segments needed

   This is a private helper method
%End

    static int calculateSegmentsByConstant( double radius, double constant, int minSegments );
%Docstring
Calculate the number of segments using a simple linear relationship with radius.

This function implements the simplest approach to circle discretization by using
a direct linear relationship between the radius and the number of segments.
While not mathematically precise for error control, it provides a quick and
intuitive approximation that can be useful when exact error bounds aren't required.

Mathematical approach:
1. Linear scaling: segments = constant * radius

Larger constant = more segments = better approximation
Smaller constant = fewer segments = coarser approximation

:param radius: The radius of the circle to approximate
:param constant: Multiplier that determines the density of segments
:param minSegments: The minimum number of segments to use

:return: The number of segments needed

   This is a private helper method
