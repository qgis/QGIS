class QgsCircle : QgsEllipse
{
%Docstring
Circle geometry type.

A circle is defined by a center point with a radius and an azimuth.
The azimuth is the north angle to the semi-major axis, in degrees. By default, the semi-major axis is oriented to the north (0 degrees).

    QgsCircle();

    QgsCircle( const QgsPoint &center, double radius, double azimuth = 0 );
%Docstring
Constructs a circle by defining all the members.

:param center: The center of the circle.
:param radius: The radius of the circle.
:param azimuth: Angle in degrees started from the North to the first quadrant.
%End

    static QgsCircle from2Points( const QgsPoint &pt1, const QgsPoint &pt2 );
%Docstring
Constructs a circle by 2 points on the circle.
The center point can have m value which is the result from the midpoint
operation between ``pt1`` and ``pt2``. Z dimension is also supported and
is retrieved from the first 3D point amongst ``pt1`` and ``pt2``.
The radius is calculated from the 2D distance between ``pt1`` and ``pt2``.
The azimuth is the angle between ``pt1`` and ``pt2``.

:param pt1: First point.
:param pt2: Second point.
%End

    static QgsCircle from3Points( const QgsPoint &pt1, const QgsPoint &pt2, const QgsPoint &pt3, double epsilon = 1E-8 );
%Docstring
Constructs a circle by 3 points on the circle.
M value is dropped for the center point.
Z dimension is supported and is retrieved from the first 3D point
amongst ``pt1``, ``pt2`` and ``pt3``.
The azimuth always takes the default value.
If the points are colinear an empty circle is returned.

:param pt1: First point.
:param pt2: Second point.
:param pt3: Third point.
:param epsilon: Value used to compare point.
%End

    static QgsCircle fromCenterDiameter( const QgsPoint &center, double diameter, double azimuth = 0 );
%Docstring
Constructs a circle by a center point and a diameter.
The center point keeps z and m values from ``center``.

:param center: Center point.
:param diameter: Diameter of the circle.
:param azimuth: Azimuth of the circle.
%End


    static QgsCircle fromCenterPoint( const QgsPoint &center, const QgsPoint &pt1 );
%Docstring
Constructs a circle by a center point and another point.
The center point keeps z and m values from ``center``.
Axes are calculated from the 2D distance between ``center`` and ``pt1``.
The azimuth is the angle between ``center`` and ``pt1``.

:param center: Center point.
:param pt1: A point on the circle.

%Docstring
Constructs a circle by 3 tangents on the circle (aka inscribed circle of a triangle).
Z and m values are dropped for the center point.
The azimuth always takes the default value.

:param pt1_tg1: First point of the first tangent.
:param pt2_tg1: Second point of the first tangent.
:param pt1_tg2: First point of the second tangent.
:param pt2_tg2: Second point of the second tangent.

%End

    static QgsCircle fromExtent( const QgsPoint &pt1, const QgsPoint &pt2 );
%Docstring
Constructs a circle by an extent (aka bounding box / :py:class:`QgsRectangle`).
The center point can have m value which is the result from the midpoint
operation between ``pt1`` and ``pt2``. Z dimension is also supported and
is retrieved from the first 3D point amongst ``pt1`` and ``pt2``.
Axes are calculated from the 2D distance between ``pt1`` and ``pt2``.
The azimuth always takes the default value.

:param pt1: First corner.
:param pt2: Second corner.
%End

    static QgsCircle minimalCircleFrom3Points( const QgsPoint &pt1, const QgsPoint &pt2, const QgsPoint &pt3, double epsilon = 1E-8 );
%Docstring
Constructs the smallest circle from 3 points.
Z and m values are dropped for the center point.
The azimuth always takes the default value.
If the points are colinear an empty circle is returned.

:param pt1: First point.
:param pt2: Second point.
:param pt3: Third point.
:param epsilon: Value used to compare point.
%End

    int intersections( const QgsCircle &other, QgsPoint &intersection1 /Out/, QgsPoint &intersection2 /Out/, bool useZ = false ) const;
%Docstring
Calculates the intersections points between this circle and an ``other`` circle.

If found, the intersection points will be stored in ``intersection1`` and ``intersection2``.

By default this method does not consider any z values and instead treats the circles as 2-dimensional.
If ``useZ`` is set to true, then an intersection will only occur if the z values of both circles are
equal. In this case the points returned for ``intersection1`` and ``intersection2`` will contain
the z value of the circle intersections.

:return: number of intersection points found.

.. versionadded:: 3.2

    bool tangentToPoint( const QgsPointXY &p, QgsPointXY &pt1 /Out/, QgsPointXY &pt2 /Out/ ) const;
%Docstring
Calculates the tangent points between this circle and the point ``p``.

If found, the tangent points will be stored in ``pt1`` and ``pt2``.

Note that this method is 2D only and does not consider the z-value of the circle.

:return: true if tangent was found.

                       QgsPointXY &line2P1 /Out/, QgsPointXY &line2P2 /Out/ ) const;
%Docstring
Calculates the outer tangent points between this circle
and an ``other`` circle.

The outer tangent points correspond to the points at which the two lines
which are drawn so that they are tangential to both circles touch
the circles.

The first tangent line is described by the points
stored in ``line1P1`` and ``line1P2``,
and the second line is described by the points stored in ``line2P1``
and ``line2P2``.

Returns the number of tangents (either 0 or 2).

Note that this method is 2D only and does not consider the z-value of the circle.
