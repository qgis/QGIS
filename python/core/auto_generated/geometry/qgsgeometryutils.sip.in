A Z dimension is added to ``point`` if one of the point in the list
``points`` is in 3D. Moreover, the Z value of ``point`` is updated with.

:param points: List of points in which a 3D point is searched.
:param point: The point to update with Z dimension and value.

:return: true if the point is updated, false otherwise
