    static int leftOfLine( const double x, const double y, const double x1, const double y1, const double x2, const double y2 ) /HoldGIL/;
%Docstring
Returns a value < 0 if the point (``x``, ``y``) is left of the line from (``x1``, ``y1``) -> (``x2``, ``y2``).
A positive return value indicates the point is to the right of the line.

If the return value is 0, then the test was unsuccessful (e.g. due to testing a point exactly
on the line, or exactly in line with the segment) and the result is undefined.

    static void perpendicularOffsetPointAlongSegment( double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2, double proportion, double offset, double *x /Out/, double *y /Out/ );
%Docstring
Calculates a point a certain ``proportion`` of the way along the segment from (``x1``, ``y1``) to (``x2``, ``y2``),

    static int closestSideOfRectangle( double right, double bottom, double left, double top, double x, double y );
%Docstring
Returns a number representing the closest side of a rectangle defined by /a right,
``bottom``, ``left``, ``top`` to the point at (``x``, ``y``), where
the point may be in the interior of the rectangle or outside it.

1. Point is closest to top side of rectangle
2. Point is located on the top-right diagonal of rectangle, equally close to the top and right sides
3. Point is closest to right side of rectangle
4. Point is located on the bottom-right diagonal of rectangle, equally close to the bottom and right sides

6. Point is located on the bottom-left diagonal of rectangle, equally close to the bottom and left sides
7. Point is closest to left side of rectangle
8. Point is located on the top-left diagonal of rectangle, equally close to the top and left sides

   This method effectively partitions the space outside of the rectangle into Voronoi cells, so a point
   to the top left of the rectangle may be assigned to the left or top sides based on its position relative
   to the diagonal line extended from the rectangle's top-left corner.

with specified angles (azimuth and inclination), using Cartesian mathematics.
M value is preserved.
resultX, resultY, resultZ are coordinates of the point projected.
If a 2D point is projected a 3D point will be returned except if
inclination is 90. A 3D point is always returned if a 3D point is projected.

:param aX: x-coordinate of the point to project
:param aY: y-coordinate of the point to project
:param aZ: z-coordinate of the point to project
:param distance: distance to project
:param azimuth: angle to project in X Y, clockwise in degrees starting from north
:param inclination: angle to project in Z (3D). If the point is 2D, the Z value is assumed to be 0.

:return: - resultX: Output parameter, x-coordinates of the point projected.
         - resultY: Output parameter, y-coordinates of the point projected.
         - resultZ: Output parameter, z-coordinates of the point projected.

    static double azimuth( double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2 ) /HoldGIL/;
%Docstring
Calculates Cartesian azimuth between points (``x1``, ``y1``) and (``x2``, ``y2``)  (clockwise in degree, starting from north)

:param x1: x-coordinate of the start point
:param y1: y-coordinate of the start point
:param x2: x-coordinate of the end point
:param y2: y-coordinate of the end point
