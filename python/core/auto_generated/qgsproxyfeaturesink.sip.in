class QgsProxyFeatureSink : QgsFeatureSink
{
%Docstring(signature="appended")
A simple feature sink which proxies feature addition on to another feature sink.

This class is designed to allow factory methods which always return new :py:class:`QgsFeatureSink`
objects. Since it is not always possible to create an entirely new :py:class:`QgsFeatureSink`
(e.g. if the feature sink is a layer's data provider), a new :py:class:`QgsProxyFeatureSink`
can instead be returned which forwards features on to the destination sink. The
proxy sink can be safely deleted without affecting the destination sink.
%End

%TypeHeaderCode
#include "qgsproxyfeaturesink.h"
%End
  public:

    QgsProxyFeatureSink( QgsFeatureSink *sink );
%Docstring
Constructs a new QgsProxyFeatureSink which forwards features onto a destination ``sink``.

    virtual bool addFeature( QgsFeature &feature, QgsFeatureSink::Flags flags = QgsFeatureSink::Flags() );
    virtual bool addFeatures( QgsFeatureList &features, QgsFeatureSink::Flags flags = QgsFeatureSink::Flags() );
    virtual bool addFeatures( QgsFeatureIterator &iterator, QgsFeatureSink::Flags flags = QgsFeatureSink::Flags() );
    virtual QString lastError() const;

    QgsFeatureSink *destinationSink();
%Docstring
Returns the destination :py:class:`QgsFeatureSink` which the proxy will forward features to.
