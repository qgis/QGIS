class QgsProxyFeatureSink : QgsFeatureSink
{
%Docstring
A simple feature sink which proxies feature addition on to another feature sink.

This class is designed to allow factory methods which always return new QgsFeatureSink
objects. Since it is not always possible to create an entirely new QgsFeatureSink
(e.g. if the feature sink is a layer's data provider), a new QgsProxyFeatureSink
can instead be returned which forwards features on to the destination sink. The
proxy sink can be safely deleted without affecting the destination sink.

  public:

    QgsProxyFeatureSink( QgsFeatureSink *sink );

Constructs a new QgsProxyFeatureSink which forwards features onto a destination ``sink``.

    QgsFeatureSink *destinationSink();

Returns the destination QgsFeatureSink which the proxy will forward features to.
