class QgsReadWriteLocker
{
%Docstring
The QgsReadWriteLocker class is a convenience class that simplifies locking and unlocking QReadWriteLocks.

Locking and unlocking a QReadWriteLocks in complex functions and statements or in exception handling code
is error-prone and difficult to debug.
QgsReadWriteLocker can be used in such situations to ensure that the state of the lock is always well-defined.

QgsReadWriteLocker should be created within a function where a QReadWriteLock needs to be locked.
The lock may be locked when QgsReadWriteLocker is created or when changeMode is called.
You can unlock and relock the lock with unlock() and changeMode().
If locked, the mutex will be unlocked when the QgsReadWriteLocker is destroyed.

    QgsReadWriteLocker( QReadWriteLock &lock, Mode mode );
%Docstring
Create a new QgsReadWriteLocker for ``lock`` and initialize in ``mode``.
%End

    void changeMode( Mode mode );
%Docstring
Change the mode of the lock to ``mode``.
The lock will be unlocked and relocked as required.
%End

    void unlock();
%Docstring
Unlocks the lock.
Equivalent to doing ``changeMode( QgsReadWriteLocker.Unlock );``
