class QgsVectorLayer : QgsMapLayer, QgsExpressionContextGenerator, QgsExpressionContextScopeGenerator, QgsFeatureSink, QgsFeatureSource
{
%Docstring(signature="appended")
Represents a vector layer which manages a vector based data sets.

The :py:class:`QgsVectorLayer` is instantiated by specifying the name of a data provider,
such as postgres or wfs, and url defining the specific data set to connect to.
The vector layer constructor in turn instantiates a :py:class:`QgsVectorDataProvider` subclass
corresponding to the provider type, and passes it the url. The data provider
connects to the data source.

The :py:class:`QgsVectorLayer` provides a common interface to the different data types. It also
manages editing transactions by buffering layer edits until they are written to the
underlying :py:class:`QgsVectorDataProvider`. Before edits can be made a call to :py:func:`~startEditing`
is required. Any edits made to a :py:class:`QgsVectorLayer` are then held in memory only, and
are not written to the underlying :py:class:`QgsVectorDataProvider` until a call to :py:func:`~commitChanges`
is made. Buffered edits can be rolled back and discarded without altering the
underlying provider by calling :py:func:`~rollBack`.

Sample usage of the :py:class:`QgsVectorLayer` class:

.. code-block:: python

         uri = "point?crs=epsg:4326&field=id:integer"
         scratchLayer = QgsVectorLayer(uri, "Scratch point layer",  "memory")

The main data providers supported by QGIS are listed below.

Vector data providers
---------------------

Memory data providerType (memory)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The memory data provider is used to construct in memory data, for example scratch
data or data generated from spatial operations such as contouring. There is no
inherent persistent storage of the data. The data source uri is constructed. The
url specifies the geometry type ("point", "linestring", "polygon",
"multipoint","multilinestring","multipolygon"), optionally followed by url parameters
as follows:

- crs=definition
  Defines the coordinate reference system to use for the layer.
  definition is any string accepted by :py:func:`QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem.createFromString()`
- index=yes
  Specifies that the layer will be constructed with a spatial index
- field=name:type(length,precision)
  Defines an attribute of the layer. Multiple field parameters can be added
  to the data provider definition. type is one of "integer", "double", "string".

An example url is "Point?crs=epsg:4326&field=id:integer&field=name:string(20)&index=yes"

Since QGIS 3.4 when closing a project, the application shows a warning about potential data
loss if there are any non-empty memory layers present. If your memory layer should not
trigger such warning, it is possible to suppress that by setting the following custom variable:


.. code-block:: python

         layer.setCustomProperty("skipMemoryLayersCheck", 1)



OGR data provider (ogr)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Accesses data using the OGR drivers (https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/index.html). The url
is the OGR connection string. A wide variety of data formats can be accessed using this
driver, including file based formats used by many GIS systems, database formats, and
web services. Some of these formats are also supported by custom data providers listed
below.

SpatiaLite data provider (spatialite)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Access data in a SpatiaLite database. The url defines the connection parameters, table,
geometry column, and other attributes. The url can be constructed using the
:py:class:`QgsDataSourceUri` class.

PostgreSQL data provider (postgres)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connects to a PostgreSQL database. The url defines the connection parameters, table,
geometry column, and other attributes. The url can be constructed using the
:py:class:`QgsDataSourceUri` class.

Microsoft SQL server data provider (mssql)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connects to a Microsoft SQL server database. The url defines the connection parameters, table,
geometry column, and other attributes. The url can be constructed using the
:py:class:`QgsDataSourceUri` class.

WFS (web feature service) data provider (wfs)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Used to access data provided by a web feature service.

The url can be a HTTP url to a WFS server (legacy, e.g. http://foobar/wfs?TYPENAME=xxx&SRSNAME=yyy[&FILTER=zzz]), or,
starting with QGIS 2.16, a URI constructed using the :py:class:`QgsDataSourceUri` class with the following parameters :

- url=string (mandatory): HTTP url to a WFS server endpoint. e.g http://foobar/wfs
- typename=string (mandatory): WFS typename
- srsname=string (recommended): SRS like 'EPSG:XXXX'
- username=string
- password=string
- authcfg=string
- version=auto/1.0.0/1.1.0/2.0.0
- sql=string: full SELECT SQL statement with optional WHERE, ORDER BY and possibly with JOIN if supported on server
- filter=string: QGIS expression or OGC/FES filter
- restrictToRequestBBOX=1: to download only features in the view extent (or more generally
  in the bounding box of the feature iterator)
- pageSize=number: number of features to retrieve in a single request (WFS 2)
- maxNumFeatures=number: maximum number of features to retrieve (possibly across several multiple paging requests)
- IgnoreAxisOrientation=1: to ignore EPSG axis order for WFS 1.1 or 2.0
- InvertAxisOrientation=1: to invert axis order
- hideDownloadProgressDialog=1: to hide the download progress dialog

The ‘FILTER’ query string parameter can be used to filter
the WFS feature type. The ‘FILTER’ key value can either be a QGIS expression
or an OGC XML filter. If the value is set to a QGIS expression the driver will
turn it into OGC XML filter before passing it to the WFS server. Beware the
QGIS expression filter only supports” =, !=, <, >, <=, >=, AND, OR, NOT, LIKE, IS NULL”
attribute operators, “BBOX, Disjoint, Intersects, Touches, Crosses, Contains, Overlaps, Within”
spatial binary operators and the QGIS local “geomFromWKT, geomFromGML”
geometry constructor functions.

OGC API - Features data provider (oapif)
~~~~~~~~-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Used to access data provided by a OGC API - Features server.

The URI should be constructed using the :py:class:`QgsDataSourceUri` class with the following parameters:

- url=string (mandatory): HTTP url to a OGC API - Features landing page.
- typename=string (mandatory): Collection id
- username=string
- password=string
- authcfg=string
- filter=string: QGIS expression (only datetime filtering is forwarded to the server)
- restrictToRequestBBOX=1: to download only features in the view extent (or more generally
  in the bounding box of the feature iterator)
- pageSize=number: number of features to retrieve in a single request
- maxNumFeatures=number: maximum number of features to retrieve (possibly across several multiple paging requests)
- hideDownloadProgressDialog=1: to hide the download progress dialog.

Also note:

- You can use various functions available in the QGIS Expression list,
  however the function must exist server side and have the same name and arguments to work.
- Use the special $geometry parameter to provide the layer geometry column as input
  into the spatial binary operators e.g intersects($geometry, geomFromWKT('POINT (5 6)'))

Delimited text file data provider (delimitedtext)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Accesses data in a delimited text file, for example CSV files generated by
spreadsheets. The contents of the file are split into columns based on specified
delimiter characters.  Each record may be represented spatially either by an
X and Y coordinate column, or by a WKT (well known text) formatted columns.

The url defines the filename, the formatting options (how the
text in the file is divided into data fields, and which fields contain the
X,Y coordinates or WKT text definition.  The options are specified as url query
items.

At its simplest the url can just be the filename, in which case it will be loaded
as a CSV formatted file.

The url may include the following items:

- encoding=UTF-8

Defines the character encoding in the file.  The default is UTF-8.  To use
the default encoding for the operating system use "System".

- type=(csv|regexp|whitespace|plain)

Defines the algorithm used to split records into columns. Records are
defined by new lines, except for csv format files for which quoted fields
may span multiple records.  The default type is csv.

- "csv" splits the file based on three sets of characters:
  delimiter characters, quote characters,
  and escape characters.  Delimiter characters mark the end
  of a field. Quote characters enclose a field which can contain
  delimiter characters, and newlines.  Escape characters cause the
  following character to be treated literally (including delimiter,
  quote, and newline characters).  Escape and quote characters must
  be different from delimiter characters. Escape characters that are
  also quote characters are treated specially - they can only
  escape themselves within quotes.  Elsewhere they are treated as
  quote characters.  The defaults for delimiter, quote, and escape
  are ',', '"', '"'.
- "regexp" splits each record using a regular expression (see QRegularExpression
  documentation for details).
- "whitespace" splits each record based on whitespace (on or more whitespace
  characters.  Leading whitespace in the record is ignored.
- "plain" is provided for backwards compatibility.  It is equivalent to
  CSV except that the default quote characters are single and double quotes,
  and there is no escape characters.
- delimiter=characters

Defines the delimiter characters used for csv and plain type files, or the
regular expression for regexp type files.  It is a literal string of characters
except that "\t" may be used to represent a tab character.

- quote=characters

Defines the characters that are used as quote characters for csv and plain type
files.

- escape=characters

Defines the characters used to escape delimiter, quote, and newline characters.

- skipLines=n

Defines the number of lines to ignore at the beginning of the file (default 0)

- useHeader=(yes|no)

Defines whether the first record in the file (after skipped lines) contains
column names (default yes)

- trimFields=(yes|no)

If yes then leading and trailing whitespace will be removed from fields

- skipEmptyFields=(yes|no)

If yes then empty fields will be discarded (equivalent to concatenating consecutive
delimiters)

- maxFields=#

Specifies the maximum number of fields to load for each record.  Additional
fields will be discarded.  Default is 0 - load all fields.

- decimalPoint=c

Defines a character that is used as a decimal point in the numeric columns
The default is '.'.

- xField=column yField=column

Defines the name of the columns holding the x and y coordinates for XY point geometries.
If the useHeader is no (ie there are no column names), then this is the column
number (with the first column as 1).

- xyDms=(yes|no)

If yes then the X and Y coordinates are interpreted as
degrees/minutes/seconds format (fairly permissively),
or degree/minutes format.

- wktField=column

Defines the name of the columns holding the WKT geometry definition for WKT geometries.
If the useHeader is no (ie there are no column names), then this is the column
number (with the first column as 1).

- geomType=(point|line|polygon|none)

Defines the geometry type for WKT type geometries.  QGIS will only display one
type of geometry for the layer - any others will be ignored when the file is
loaded.  By default the provider uses the type of the first geometry in the file.
Use geomType to override this type.

geomType can also be set to none, in which case the layer is loaded without
geometries.

- subset=expression

Defines an expression that will identify a subset of records to display

- crs=crsstring

Defines the coordinate reference system used for the layer.  This can be
any string accepted by :py:func:`QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem.createFromString()`

- subsetIndex=(yes|no)

Determines whether the provider generates an index to improve the efficiency
of subsets.  The default is yes

- spatialIndex=(yes|no)

Determines whether the provider generates a spatial index.  The default is no.

- watchFile=(yes|no)

Defines whether the file will be monitored for changes. The default is
to monitor for changes.

- quiet

Errors encountered loading the file will not be reported in a user dialog if
quiet is included (They will still be shown in the output log).

GPX data provider (gpx)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provider reads tracks, routes, and waypoints from a GPX file.  The url
defines the name of the file, and the type of data to retrieve from it
("track", "route", or "waypoint").

An example url is "/home/user/data/holiday.gpx?type=route"

Grass data provider (grass)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provider to display vector data in a GRASS GIS layer.

in-memory changes are left untouched and are not discarded. This allows editing to
continue if the commit failed on e.g. a disallowed value in a Postgres
database - the user can re-edit and try again.

The commits occur in distinct stages,

geometries, delete features, delete attributes)

that the user has some chance of repairing the damage cleanly.
