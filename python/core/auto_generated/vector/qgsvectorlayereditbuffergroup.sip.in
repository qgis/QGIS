class QgsVectorLayerEditBufferGroup : QObject
{
%Docstring(signature="appended")
The edit buffer group manages a group of edit buffers. Commands like commit and rollback are
managed by the group invokes individual :py:func:`~addFeature`, :py:func:`~deleteFeature`, ... in the correct order
across all contained edit buffers.

Gets the set of modified layers currently managed by this edit buffer group.

Start editing

    bool commitChanges( QStringList &commitErrors, bool stopEditing = true );
%Docstring
Attempts to commit any changes to disk.  Returns the result of the attempt.
If a commit fails, the in-memory changes are left alone.

This allows editing to continue if the commit failed on e.g. a
disallowed value in a Postgres database - the user can re-edit and try
again.

The commits occur in distinct stages,
(add attributes, add features, change attribute values, change
geometries, delete features, delete attributes)
so if a stage fails, it's difficult to roll back cleanly.
Therefore any error message also includes which stage failed so
that the user has some chance of repairing the damage cleanly.

:return: ``True`` on success

%Docstring
Stop editing and discard the edits

:return: ``False`` if errors occurred during rollback
%End

Returns ``True`` if the layers are in editing mode
