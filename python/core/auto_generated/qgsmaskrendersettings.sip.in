    double simplifyTolerance() const;
%Docstring
Returns the simplification tolerance (in painter units) to use for on-the-fly simplification of mask paths while rendering.

A tolerance of 0 indicates no simplification. (No simplification is the default behavior).

.. note::

   This property is only used when exporting to vector formats, and is ignored during raster format based rendering.

    void setSimplificationTolerance( double tolerance );
%Docstring
Sets a simplification tolerance (in painter units) to use for on-the-fly simplification of mask paths while rendering.

This will result in simpler, generalised paths.

Set ``tolerance`` to 0 to disable simplification. (No simplification is the default behavior).

.. note::

   This property is only used when exporting to vector formats, and is ignored during raster format based rendering.
