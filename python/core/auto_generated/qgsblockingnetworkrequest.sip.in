class QgsBlockingNetworkRequest : QObject
{
%Docstring
A thread safe class for performing blocking (sync) network requests, with full support for QGIS proxy
and authentication settings.

This class should be used whenever a blocking network request is required. Unlike implementations
which rely on QApplication.processEvents() or creation of a QEventLoop, this class is completely
thread safe and can be used on either the main thread or background threads without issue.

Redirects are automatically handled by the class.

After completion of a request, the reply content should be retrieved by calling getReplyContent().
This method returns a QgsNetworkReplyContent container, which is safe and cheap to copy and pass
between threads without issue.

    ErrorCode get( QNetworkRequest &request, bool forceRefresh = false, QgsFeedback *feedback = 0 );
%Docstring
Performs a "get" operation on the specified ``request``.

If ``forceRefresh`` is false then previously cached replies may be used for the request. If
it is set to true then a new query is always performed.

If an authCfg() has been set, then any authentication configuration required will automatically be applied to
``request``. There is no need to manually apply the authentication to the request prior to calling
this method.

The optional ``feedback`` argument can be used to abort ongoing requests.

The method will return NoError if the get operation was successful. The contents of the reply can be retrieved
by calling reply().

If an error was encountered then a specific ErrorCode will be returned, and a detailed error message
can be retrieved by calling errorMessage().

    ErrorCode post( QNetworkRequest &request, const QByteArray &data, bool forceRefresh = false, QgsFeedback *feedback = 0 );

Performs a "post" operation on the specified ``request``, using the given ``data``.

If ``forceRefresh`` is false then previously cached replies may be used for the request. If
it is set to true then a new query is always performed.

``request``. There is no need to manually apply the authentication to the request prior to calling

Returns the error message string, after a get() or post() request has been made.\

Sets the authentication config id which should be used during the request.

Aborts the network request immediately.

  signals:

Emitted when when data arrives during a request.

Emitted once a request has finished downloading.
