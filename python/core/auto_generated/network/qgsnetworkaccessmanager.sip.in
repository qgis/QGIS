%Docstring(signature="appended")
network access manager for QGIS

This class implements the QGIS network access manager.  It's a singleton
that can be used across QGIS.

Plugins can insert proxy factories and thereby redirect requests to
individual proxies.

If no proxy factories are there or none returns a proxy for an URL a
fallback proxy can be set.  There's also a exclude list that defines URLs
that the fallback proxy should not be used for, then no proxy will be used.

.. versionadded:: 1.5
%End

%TypeHeaderCode
#include "qgsnetworkaccessmanager.h"
%End
  public:

    static QgsNetworkAccessManager *instance( Qt::ConnectionType connectionType = Qt::BlockingQueuedConnection );
%Docstring
Returns a pointer to the active QgsNetworkAccessManager
for the current thread.

With the ``connectionType`` parameter it is possible to setup the default connection
type that is used to handle signals that might require user interaction and therefore
need to be handled on the main thread. See in-depth discussion below.

:param connectionType: In most cases the default of using a ``Qt.BlockingQueuedConnection``
                       is ok, to make a background thread wait for the main thread to answer such a request is
                       fine and anything else is dangerous.
                       However, in case the request was started on the main thread, one should execute a
                       local event loop in a helper thread and freeze the main thread for the duration of the
                       download. In this case, if an authentication request is sent from the background thread
                       network access manager, the background thread should be blocked, the main thread be woken
                       up, :py:func:`~QgsNetworkAccessManager.processEvents` executed once, the main thread frozen again and the background thread
                       continued.

    static QgsNetworkReplyContent blockingGet( QNetworkRequest &request, const QString &authCfg = QString(), bool forceRefresh = false, QgsFeedback *feedback = 0 );
%Docstring
Posts a GET request to obtain the contents of the target request and returns a new :py:class:`QgsNetworkReplyContent` object for reading.
The current thread will be blocked until the request is returned.

This method is safe to call in either the main thread or a worker thread.

If ``forceRefresh`` is ``False`` then previously cached replies may be used for the request. If
it is set to ``True`` then a new query is always performed.

If an ``authCfg`` has been specified, then that authentication configuration required will automatically be applied to
``request``. There is no need to manually apply the authentication to the request prior to calling
this method.

The optional ``feedback`` argument can be used to abort ongoing requests.

The contents of the reply will be returned after the request is completed or an error occurs.

Posts a POST request to obtain the contents of the target ``request``, using the given ``data``, and returns a new
:py:class:`QgsNetworkReplyContent` object for reading. The current thread will be blocked until the request is returned.

This method is safe to call in either the main thread or a worker thread.

The ``processor`` function takes the QNetworkRequest as its argument, and can mutate the request if necessary.
