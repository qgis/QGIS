class QgsFileDownloader : QObject
{
%Docstring(signature="appended")
:py:class:`QgsFileDownloader` is a utility class for downloading files.

To use this class, it is necessary to pass the URL and an output file name as
arguments to the constructor, the download will start immediately.

The download is asynchronous.

The object will destroy itself when the request completes, errors or is canceled.
An optional authentication configuration can be specified.

.. note::

   This class was part of the GUI library from QGIS 2.18.1 until QGIS 3.0

.. versionadded:: 3.0

    QgsFileDownloader( const QUrl &url, const QString &outputFileName, const QString &authcfg = QString(), bool delayStart = false, Qgis::HttpMethod httpMethod = Qgis::HttpMethod::Get, const QByteArray &data = QByteArray() );
%Docstring
QgsFileDownloader

:param url: the download URL
:param outputFileName: file name where the downloaded content will be stored
:param authcfg: optionally apply this authentication configuration
:param delayStart: if ``True``, the download will not be commenced immediately and must
                   be triggered by a later call to :py:func:`~QgsFileDownloader.startDownload`. This can be useful if connections need
                   to be made to the downloader and there's a chance the download will emit
                   signals before these connections have been made.
:param httpMethod: Method for the HTTP request : GET or POST, since QGIS 3.22
:param data: If the request is POST, some data can be added, since QGIS 3.22
%End

  signals:
    void downloadCompleted( const QUrl &url );
%Docstring
Emitted when the download has completed successfully
%End
    void downloadExited();
%Docstring
Emitted always when the downloader exits
%End

    void downloadCanceled();
%Docstring
Emitted when the download was canceled by the user.

Emitted when an error makes the download fail

Emitted when data are ready to be processed

%Docstring
Call to abort the download and delete this object after the cancellation
has been processed.
