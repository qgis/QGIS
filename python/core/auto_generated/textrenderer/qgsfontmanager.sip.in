class QgsFontManager : QObject
{
%Docstring(signature="appended")

Manages available fonts and font installation for a QGIS instance.

.. note::

   :py:class:`QgsFontManager` is not usually directly created, but rather accessed through :py:func:`QgsApplication.fontManager()`.

.. versionadded:: 3.28
%End

%TypeHeaderCode
#include "qgsfontmanager.h"
%End
  public:


    explicit QgsFontManager( QObject *parent /TransferThis/ = 0 );
%Docstring
Constructor for QgsFontManager, with the specified ``parent`` object.

.. note::

   QgsFontManager is not usually directly created, but rather accessed through :py:func:`QgsApplication.fontManager()`.
%End

    QMap< QString, QString > fontFamilyReplacements() const;
%Docstring
Returns the map of automatic font family replacements.

This map is used to transparently map an original font family to an alternative
font family, e.g. to permit graceful handling of opening projects which reference
fonts which are not available on the system.

The map keys are the original font family names, and the values are the alternative
replacement family to use for the font.

.. note::

   This method is thread safe.

.. seealso:: :py:func:`addFontFamilyReplacement`

.. seealso:: :py:func:`setFontFamilyReplacements`
%End

    void addFontFamilyReplacement( const QString &original, const QString &replacement );
%Docstring
Adds a new font replacement from the ``original`` font family to a ``replacement`` font family.

This is used to transparently map an original font family to an alternative
font family, e.g. to permit graceful handling of opening projects which reference
fonts which are not available on the system.

The replacement map is stored locally and persists across QGIS sessions.

If ``replacement`` is an empty string then any existing mapping for the ``original``
family will be removed.

.. note::

   This method is thread safe.

.. seealso:: :py:func:`fontFamilyReplacements`

.. seealso:: :py:func:`setFontFamilyReplacements`
%End

    void setFontFamilyReplacements( const QMap< QString, QString> &replacements );
%Docstring
Sets the map of automatic font family ``replacements``.

This map is used to transparently map an original font family to an alternative
font family, e.g. to permit graceful handling of opening projects which reference
fonts which are not available on the system.

The map keys are the original font family names, and the values are the alternative
replacement family to use for the font.

The replacement map is stored locally and persists across QGIS sessions.

.. note::

   This method is thread safe.

.. seealso:: :py:func:`fontFamilyReplacements`

.. seealso:: :py:func:`addFontFamilyReplacement`
%End

    QString processFontFamilyName( const QString &name ) const;
%Docstring
Processes a font family ``name``, applying any matching :py:func:`~QgsFontManager.fontFamilyReplacements`
to the name.

.. note::

   This method is thread safe.
%End


    bool tryToDownloadFontFamily( const QString &family, QString &matchedFamily /Out/ );
%Docstring
Tries to download and install the specified font ``family``.

This method will attempt to download missing fonts, if the font download URL
is known and the font is freely licensed.

Returns ``True`` if a download link for the family is known and the
download has commenced, or ``False`` if the family is not known and cannot be
automatically downloaded.

The actual download operation occurs in a background task, and this method
returns immediately. Connect to :py:func:`~QgsFontManager.fontDownloaded` in order to respond when the
font is installed and available for use.

.. warning::

   Before calling this method a :py:class:`QgsApplication` must be fully initialized
   and a call to :py:func:`~QgsFontManager.enableFontDownloadsForSession` made.

:param family: input font family name to try to match to known fonts

:return: - ``True`` if match was successful and the download will occur
         - matchedFamily: will be set to found font family if a match was successful
%End

    void enableFontDownloadsForSession();
%Docstring
Enables font downloads the the current QGIS session.

.. warning::

   Ensure that the :py:class:`QgsApplication` is fully initialized before calling this method.
%End

    QString urlForFontDownload( const QString &family, QString &matchedFamily /Out/ ) const;
%Docstring
Returns the URL at which the font ``family`` can be downloaded.

This method relies on a hardcoded list of available freely licensed fonts, and will
return an empty string for any font families not present in this list.

:param family: input font family name to try to match to known fonts

:return: - URL to download font, or an empty string if no URL is available
         - matchedFamily: will be set to found font family if a match was successful
%End

    void downloadAndInstallFont( const QUrl &url, const QString &identifier = QString() );
%Docstring
Downloads a font and installs in the user's profile/fonts directory as an application font.

The download will proceed in a background task.

The optional ``identifier`` string can be used to specify a user-friendly name for the download
tasks, e.g. the font family name if known.

.. seealso:: :py:func:`fontDownloaded`

.. seealso:: :py:func:`fontDownloadErrorOccurred`
%End

    bool installFontsFromData( const QByteArray &data, QString &errorMessage /Out/, QStringList &families /Out/, QString &licenseDetails /Out/, const QString &filename = QString() );
%Docstring
Installs local user fonts from the specified raw ``data``.

The ``data`` array may correspond to the contents of a TTF or OTF font file,
or a zipped archive of font files.

:param data: raw font data or zipped font data
:param filename: filename hint for destination file. Will be ignored for archived content (e.g. zip file data)

:return: - ``True`` if installation was successful.
         - errorMessage: will be set to a descriptive error message if the installation fails
         - families: will be populated with a list of font families installed from the data
         - licenseDetails: will be populated with font license details, if found
%End

    void addUserFontDirectory( const QString &directory );
%Docstring
Adds a ``directory`` to use for user fonts.

This directory will be scanned for any TTF or OTF font files, which will automatically be added and made
available for use in the QGIS session.

Additionally, if this is the first user font directory added, any fonts downloaded via :py:func:`~QgsFontManager.downloadAndInstallFont` will be
installed into this directory.
%End

    QMap< QString, QStringList > userFontToFamilyMap() const;
%Docstring
Returns the mapping of installed user fonts to font families.

The map keys are the file names, the values are a list of families provided by the file.
%End

    bool removeUserFont( const QString &path );
%Docstring
Removes the user font at the specified ``path``.
%End

  signals:

    void fontDownloaded( const QStringList &families, const QString &licenseDetails );
%Docstring
Emitted when a font has downloaded and been locally loaded.

The ``families`` list specifies the font families contained in the downloaded font.

If found, the ``licenseDetails`` string will be populated with corresponding font license details.

.. seealso:: :py:func:`downloadAndInstallFont`

.. seealso:: :py:func:`fontDownloadErrorOccurred`
%End

    void fontDownloadErrorOccurred( const QUrl &url, const QString &identifier, const QString &error );
%Docstring
Emitted when an error occurs during font downloading.
