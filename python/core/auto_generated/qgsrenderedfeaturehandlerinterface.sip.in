class QgsRenderedFeatureHandlerInterface
{
%Docstring

An interface for classes which provider custom handlers for features rendered
as part of a map render job.

QgsRenderedFeatureHandlerInterface objects are registered in the QgsMapSettings
objects used to construct map render jobs. During the rendering operation,
the :py:func:`~handleRenderedFeature` method will be called once for every rendered feature,
allowing the handler to perform some custom task based on the provided information.

They can be used for custom tasks which operate on a set of rendered features,
such as creating spatial indexes of the location and rendered symbology bounding box
of all features rendered on a map.

  public:
    virtual ~QgsRenderedFeatureHandlerInterface();

    struct RenderedFeatureContext
    {

        RenderedFeatureContext( const QgsRenderContext &renderContext );
%Docstring
Constructor for RenderedFeatureContext.

:param renderContext: The render context which was used while rendering feature.
%End

        const QgsRenderContext &renderContext;
%Docstring
The render context which was used while rendering feature.
%End

        RenderedFeatureContext &operator=( const RenderedFeatureContext & );
    };

    virtual void handleRenderedFeature( const QgsFeature &feature, const QgsGeometry &renderedBounds, const QgsRenderedFeatureHandlerInterface::RenderedFeatureContext &context ) = 0;
%Docstring
Called whenever a ``feature`` is rendered during a map render job.

The ``renderedBounds`` argument specifies the (approximate) bounds of the rendered feature's
symbology. E.g. for point geometry features, this will be the bounding box of the marker symbol
used to symbolize the point. ``renderedBounds`` geometries are specified in painter units (not
map units).

.. warning::

   This method may be called from many different threads (for multi-threaded map render operations),
   and accordingly care must be taken to ensure that :py:func:`~QgsRenderedFeatureHandlerInterface.handleRenderedFeature` implementations are
   appropriately thread safe.

The ``context`` argument is used to provide additional context relating to the rendering of a feature.
%End

    virtual QSet<QString> usedAttributes( QgsVectorLayer *layer, const QgsRenderContext &context ) const;
%Docstring
Returns a list of attributes required by this handler, for the specified ``layer``. Attributes not listed in here may
not be requested from the provider at rendering time.
