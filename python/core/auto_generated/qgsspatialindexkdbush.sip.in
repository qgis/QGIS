class QgsSpatialIndexKDBush
{
%Docstring

A very fast static spatial index for 2D points based on a flat KD-tree.

Compared to QgsSpatialIndex, this index:
- supports single point features only (no multipoints)
- is static (features cannot be added or removed from the index after construction)
- is much faster!
- allows direct retrieval of the original feature's points, without requiring additional feature requests
- supports true "distance based" searches, i.e. return all points within a radius
from a search point

QgsSpatialIndexKDBush objects are implicitly shared and can be inexpensively copied.

  public:

    explicit QgsSpatialIndexKDBush( QgsFeatureIterator &fi, QgsFeedback *feedback = 0 );
%Docstring
Constructor - creates KDBush index and bulk loads it with features from the iterator.

The optional ``feedback`` object can be used to allow cancelation of bulk feature loading. Ownership
of ``feedback`` is not transferred, and callers must take care that the lifetime of feedback exceeds
that of the spatial index construction.

Any non-single point features encountered during iteration will be ignored and not included in the index.
