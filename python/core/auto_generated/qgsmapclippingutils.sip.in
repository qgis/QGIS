Utility functions for use when clipping map renders.

  public:

    static QList< QgsMapClippingRegion > collectClippingRegionsForLayer( const QgsRenderContext &context, const QgsMapLayer *layer );
%Docstring
Collects the list of map clipping regions from a ``context`` which apply to a map ``layer``.
%End

    static QgsGeometry calculateFeatureRequestGeometry( const QList< QgsMapClippingRegion > &regions, const QgsRenderContext &context, bool &shouldFilter );
%Docstring
Returns the geometry representing the intersection of clipping ``regions`` from ``context``.

The returned geometry will be automatically reprojected into the same CRS as the source layer, ready for use for filtering
a feature request.

:param regions: list of clip regions which apply to the layer
:param context: a render context
:param shouldFilter: will be set to ``True`` if layer's features should be filtered, i.e. one or more clipping regions applies to the layer

:return: combined clipping region for use when filtering features to render
%End

    static QgsGeometry calculateFeatureIntersectionGeometry( const QList< QgsMapClippingRegion > &regions, const QgsRenderContext &context, bool &shouldClip );
%Docstring
Returns the geometry representing the intersection of clipping ``regions`` from ``context`` which should be used to clip individual
feature geometries prior to rendering.

The returned geometry will be automatically reprojected into the same CRS as the source layer, ready for use for clipping features.

:param regions: list of clip regions which apply to the layer
:param context: a render context
:param shouldClip: will be set to ``True`` if layer's features should be filtered, i.e. one or more clipping regions applies to the layer

:return: combined clipping region for use when rendering features
%End

    static QPainterPath calculatePainterClipRegion( const QList< QgsMapClippingRegion > &regions, const QgsRenderContext &context, QgsMapLayerType layerType, bool &shouldClip );
%Docstring
Returns a QPainterPath representing the intersection of clipping ``regions`` from ``context`` which should be used to clip the painter
during rendering of a layer of the specified ``layerType``.

The returned coordinates are in painter coordinates for the destination ``context``.

:param regions: list of clip regions which apply to the layer
:param context: a render context
:param shouldClip: will be set to ``True`` if the clipping path should be applied

:return: combined painter clipping region for use when rendering maps
%End

    static QgsGeometry calculateLabelIntersectionGeometry( const QList< QgsMapClippingRegion > &regions, const QgsRenderContext &context, bool &shouldClip );
%Docstring
Returns the geometry representing the intersection of clipping ``regions`` from ``context`` which should be used to clip individual
feature geometries while registering them with labeling engines.

The returned geometry will be automatically reprojected into the same CRS as the source layer, ready for use for clipping features.

:param regions: list of clip regions which apply to the layer
:param context: a render context
:param shouldClip: will be set to ``True`` if layer's features should be clipped for labeling, i.e. one or more clipping regions applies to the layer

:return: combined clipping region for use when labeling features
