class QgsWebEnginePage : QObject
{
%Docstring(signature="appended")
A wrapper around the QWebEnginePage class, adding extra functionality.

.. warning::

   This class is only available on QGIS builds with WebEngine support enabled.

.. versionadded:: 3.36
%End

%TypeHeaderCode
#include "qgswebenginepage.h"
%End
  public:

    QgsWebEnginePage( QObject *parent /TransferThis/ = 0 );
%Docstring
Constructor for QgsWebEnginePage, with the specified ``parent`` widget.
%End
    ~QgsWebEnginePage();


    bool setContent( const QByteArray &data, const QString &mimeType = QString(), const QUrl &baseUrl = QUrl(), bool blocking = false );
%Docstring
Sets the content of the web page to ``data``. If the ``mimeType`` argument is empty, it is assumed that the content is text/plain,charset=US-ASCII

The ``baseUrl`` is optional and used to resolve relative URLs in the document, such as referenced images or stylesheets.

If ``blocking`` is ``True`` then the call will block while the HTML is loaded. Otherwise the html is loaded immediately; external objects are loaded asynchronously.

.. warning::

   Setting ``blocking`` to ``True`` involves running the event loop on the current thread. Take care when calling from the main thread as incorrect use will result in crashes.

:return: ``True`` if loading was successful
%End

    bool setHtml( const QString &html, const QUrl &baseUrl = QUrl(), bool blocking = false );
%Docstring
Sets the content of this page to ``html``.

The ``baseUrl`` is optional and used to resolve relative URLs in the document, such as referenced images or stylesheets.

If ``blocking`` is ``True`` then the call will block while the HTML is loaded. Otherwise the html is loaded immediately; external objects are loaded asynchronously.

.. note::

   This function works only for HTML, for other mime types (such as XHTML and SVG) :py:func:`~QgsWebEnginePage.setContent` should be used instead.

.. warning::

   Setting ``blocking`` to ``True`` involves running the event loop on the current thread. Take care when calling from the main thread as incorrect use will result in crashes.

:return: ``True`` if loading was successful
%End

    bool setUrl( const QUrl &url, bool blocking = false );
%Docstring
Sets the ``url`` of the web page to be displayed.

Setting this property clears the page and loads the URL.

If ``blocking`` is ``True`` then the call will block while the HTML is loaded. Otherwise the html is loaded immediately; external objects are loaded asynchronously.

.. warning::

   Setting ``blocking`` to ``True`` involves running the event loop on the current thread. Take care when calling from the main thread as incorrect use will result in crashes.

:return: ``True`` if loading was successful
%End

    QSize documentSize() const;
%Docstring
Returns the size of the page document, in pixels.

.. warning::

   If the page content was NOT loaded using a blocking method, then this method involves running the event loop on the current thread. Take care when calling from the main thread as incorrect use will result in crashes.
%End

    bool render( QPainter *painter, const QRectF &painterRect ) throw( QgsNotSupportedException );
%Docstring
Renders the web page contents to a ``painter``. Content will be rendered as vector objects.

The ``painterRect`` argument specifies the target rectangle for the page in ``painter`` coordinates.

.. warning::

   This method involves running the event loop on the current thread. Take care when calling from the main thread as incorrect use will result in crashes.

.. warning::

   This method requires a QGIS build with PDF4Qt library support.

:return: ``True`` if rendering was successful

:raises QgsNotSupportedException: on QGIS builds without PDF4Qt library support.
%End

  signals:

    void loadStarted();
%Docstring
This signal is emitted when the page starts loading content.
%End

    void loadProgress( int progress );
%Docstring
This signal is emitted when the global ``progress`` status changes.

The current value is provided by ``progress`` and scales from 0 to 100.
It accumulates changes from all the child frames.
%End

    void loadFinished( bool ok );
%Docstring
This signal is emitted when the page finishes loading content.

This signal is independent of script execution or page rendering.

``ok`` will indicate whether the load was successful or any error occurred.
%End
