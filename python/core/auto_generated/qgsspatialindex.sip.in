class QgsSpatialIndex : QgsFeatureSink
{
%Docstring

A spatial index for QgsFeature objects.

QgsSpatialIndex objects are implicitly shared and can be inexpensively copied.

.. note::

   While the underlying libspatialindex is not thread safe on some platforms, the QgsSpatialIndex
   class implements its own locks and accordingly, a single QgsSpatialIndex object can safely
   be used across multiple threads.

    QgsSpatialIndex( QgsSpatialIndex::Flags flags = 0 );
%Docstring
Constructor for QgsSpatialIndex. Creates an empty R-tree index.
%End

    explicit QgsSpatialIndex( const QgsFeatureIterator &fi, QgsFeedback *feedback = 0, QgsSpatialIndex::Flags flags = 0 );
%Docstring
Constructor - creates R-tree and bulk loads it with features from the iterator.
This is much faster approach than creating an empty index and then inserting features one by one.

The optional ``feedback`` object can be used to allow cancellation of bulk feature loading. Ownership
of ``feedback`` is not transferred, and callers must take care that the lifetime of feedback exceeds
that of the spatial index construction.

.. versionadded:: 2.8

    explicit QgsSpatialIndex( const QgsFeatureSource &source, QgsFeedback *feedback = 0, QgsSpatialIndex::Flags flags = 0 );
%Docstring
Constructor - creates R-tree and bulk loads it with features from the source.

 bool insertFeature( const QgsFeature &feature ) /Deprecated/;
%Docstring
Adds a ``feature`` to the index.

.. deprecated::
   Use addFeature() instead
%End

    virtual bool addFeature( QgsFeature &feature, QgsFeatureSink::Flags flags = 0 );

%Docstring
Adds a ``feature`` to the index.

The ``flags`` argument is ignored.

.. versionadded:: 3.4
%End

    virtual bool addFeatures( QgsFeatureList &features, QgsFeatureSink::Flags flags = 0 );

%Docstring
Adds a list of ``features`` to the index.

The ``flags`` argument is ignored.

.. seealso:: :py:func:`addFeature`
%End

 bool insertFeature( QgsFeatureId id, const QgsRectangle &bounds ) /Deprecated/;
%Docstring
Add a feature ``id`` to the index with a specified bounding box.

:return: ``True`` if feature was successfully added to index.

.. deprecated::
   Use addFeature() instead
%End

    bool addFeature( QgsFeatureId id, const QgsRectangle &bounds );
%Docstring
Add a feature ``id`` to the index with a specified bounding box.

:return: ``True`` if feature was successfully added to index.

.. versionadded:: 3.4
%End

    bool deleteFeature( const QgsFeature &feature );
%Docstring
Removes a ``feature`` from the index.
%End



    QList<QgsFeatureId> intersects( const QgsRectangle &rectangle ) const;
%Docstring
Returns a list of features with a bounding box which intersects the specified ``rectangle``.

.. note::

   The intersection test is performed based on the feature bounding boxes only, so for non-point
   geometry features it is necessary to manually test the returned features for exact geometry intersection
   when required.
%End

    QList<QgsFeatureId> nearestNeighbor( const QgsPointXY &point, int neighbors = 1, double maxDistance = 0 ) const;
%Docstring
Returns nearest neighbors to a ``point``. The number of neighbors returned is specified
by the ``neighbors`` argument.

If the ``maxDistance`` argument is greater than 0, then only features within the specified
distance of ``point`` will be considered.

Note that in some cases the number of returned features may differ from the requested
number of ``neighbors``. E.g. if not enough features exist within the ``maxDistance`` of the
search point. If multiple features are equidistant from the search ``point`` then the
number of returned feature IDs may exceed ``neighbors``.

.. warning::

   If this QgsSpatialIndex object was not constructed with the FlagStoreFeatureGeometries flag,
   then the nearest neighbor test is performed based on the feature bounding boxes ONLY, so for non-point
   geometry features this method is not guaranteed to return the actual closest neighbors.
%End

    QList<QgsFeatureId> nearestNeighbor( const QgsGeometry &geometry, int neighbors = 1, double maxDistance = 0 ) const;
%Docstring
Returns nearest neighbors to a ``geometry``. The number of neighbors returned is specified
by the ``neighbors`` argument.

If the ``maxDistance`` argument is greater than 0, then only features within the specified
distance of ``point`` will be considered.

Note that in some cases the number of returned features may differ from the requested
number of ``neighbors``. E.g. if not enough features exist within the ``maxDistance`` of the
search point. If multiple features are equidistant from the search ``point`` then the
number of returned feature IDs may exceed ``neighbors``.

   geometry features this method is not guaranteed to return the actual closest neighbors.

    SIP_PYOBJECT geometry( QgsFeatureId id ) const /TypeHint="QgsGeometry"/;
%Docstring
Returns the stored geometry for the indexed feature with matching ``id``. A KeyError will be raised if no
geometry with the specified feature id exists in the index.

Geometry is only stored if the QgsSpatialIndex was created with the FlagStoreFeatureGeometries flag.

.. versionadded:: 3.6
