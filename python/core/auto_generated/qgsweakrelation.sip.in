class QgsWeakRelation
{
%Docstring(signature="appended")
The :py:class:`QgsWeakRelation` class represent a :py:class:`QgsRelation` with possibly
unresolved layers or unmatched fields.

This class is used to store relation information attached to a
layer style, a method to attempt relation resolution is also
implemented and can be used to create a :py:class:`QgsRelation` after the
dependent layers are loaded and available.

In constrast to :py:class:`QgsRelation`, :py:class:`QgsWeakRelation` can be used to encapsulate
information about a relationship which does not currently exist in a QGIS project.
E.g. it can be used to represent a relationship which exists in a database
backend (but not within a QGIS project). Accordingly, some properties
available in :py:class:`QgsWeakRelation` are included for informational purposes only,
and cannot be translated to :py:class:`QgsRelations` or respected in QGIS relationships.
