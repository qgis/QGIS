Class defining the registry manager for QGIS server services

This class provides methods for registering and retrieving
services.

IMPORTANT: The registry hold ownership of registered services and
will call 'delete'  on cleanup

    QgsServiceRegistry();
%Docstring
Constructor
%End

    ~QgsServiceRegistry();

    QgsService *getService( const QString &name, const QString &version = QString() );
%Docstring
Retrieve a service from its name

:param name: the name of the service
:param version: the version string (optional)

:return: :py:class:`QgsService`

If the version is not provided the higher version of the service is returned
%End

    void registerService( QgsService *service /Transfer/ );
%Docstring
Register a service by its name and version

This method is intended to  be called by modules for registering
services. A module may register multiple services.

:param service: a QgsService to be registered
%End

    bool registerApi( QgsServerApi *api /Transfer/ );
%Docstring
Registers the :py:class:`QgsServerApi` ``api``

The registry takes ownership of services and will call 'delete' on cleanup

.. versionadded:: 3.10
%End

    int unregisterApi( const QString &name, const QString &version = QString() );
%Docstring
Unregisters API from its name and version

:param name: the name of the service
:param version: (optional) the specific version to unload

:return: the number of APIs unregistered

If the version is not specified then all versions from the specified API
are unloaded

.. versionadded:: 3.10
