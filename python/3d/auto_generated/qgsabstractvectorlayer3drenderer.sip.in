class QgsVectorLayer3DTilingSettings
{
%Docstring(signature="appended")
Defines configuration of how a vector layer gets tiled for 3D rendering.

Root node has the layer's extent and geometry error is set as a fraction
of the extent (see :py:func:`~maximumLeafExtent`) Child nodes are
created using quadtree approach - a node gets four children, each having
their width/height (2D extent) and geometry error halved.

For example a root tile that is 1'000 meters wide will get geometry
error set as 10 meters.

When loading data for each tile, we fetch up to
:py:func:`~maximumChunkFeatures` features. If the limit is hit, we will
recursively create children, so that user gets to see more features when
zoomed in. If the geographical extent is very large (see
:py:func:`~maximumLeafExtent`), we would still recursively create
children, even if the limit of features is not hit, to avoid jitter due
to numerical precision issues.

  public:
 int zoomLevelsCount() const /Deprecated="Since 4.0. Tiling is now done based on maximumScreenError() and maximumChunkFeatures()."/;
%Docstring
Returns number of zoom levels. One zoom level means there will be one
tile. Every extra zoom level multiplies number of tiles by four. For
example, three zoom levels will produce 16 tiles at the highest zoom
level. It is therefore recommended to keep the number of zoom levels low
to prevent excessive number of tiles.

    int maximumChunkFeatures() const;
%Docstring
Returns the maximum number of features that will be fetched in any
chunk. If more features than the maximum belong to the chunk, further
features will become available in child nodes. This is meant as a
control for performance - fewer features mean faster load times, but
user needs to zoom in more to see everything.

Sets the maximum number of features that will be fetched in any chunk.
If more features than the maximum belong to the chunk, further features
will become available in child nodes. This is meant as a control for
performance - fewer features mean faster load times, but user needs to
zoom in more to see everything.
