class QgsAdvancedDigitizingDockWidget : QgsDockWidget
{
%Docstring(signature="appended")
The :py:class:`QgsAdvancedDigitizingDockWidget` class is a dockable widget
used to handle the CAD tools on top of a selection of map tools.
It handles both the UI and the constraints. Constraints are applied
by implementing filters called from :py:class:`QgsMapToolAdvancedDigitizing`.
