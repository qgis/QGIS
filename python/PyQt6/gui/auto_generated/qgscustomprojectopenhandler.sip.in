class QgsCustomProjectOpenHandler : QObject
{
%Docstring(signature="appended")
Abstract base class that may be implemented to handle new project file types within
the QGIS application.

This interface allows extending the QGIS interface by adding support for opening additional
(non QGS/QGZ) project files, e.g. allowing plugins to add support for opening other
vendor project formats (such as ArcGIS MXD documents or MapInfo WOR workspaces).

Handler implementations should indicate the file types they support via their :py:func:`~filters`
implementation, and then implement :py:func:`~handleProjectOpen` to open the associated files.

.. versionadded:: 3.14
%End

%TypeHeaderCode
#include "qgscustomprojectopenhandler.h"
%End
  public:
    virtual bool handleProjectOpen( const QString &file ) = 0;
%Docstring
Called when the specified project ``file`` has been opened within QGIS. If ``True``
is returned, then the handler has accepted this file and it should not
be further processed (e.g. by other QgsCustomProjectOpenHandler).

It it is the subclasses' responsibility to ignore file types it cannot handle
by returning ``False`` for these.

The base class implementation does nothing.
%End

    virtual QStringList filters() const = 0;
%Docstring
Returns file filters associated with this handler, e.g. "MXD Documents (*.mxd)", "MapInfo Workspaces (*.wor)".

Each individual filter should be reflected as one entry in the returned list.
%End

    virtual bool createDocumentThumbnailAfterOpen() const;
%Docstring
Returns ``True`` if a document thumbnail should automatically be created after opening the project.

The default behavior is to return ``False``.
%End

    virtual QIcon icon() const;
%Docstring
Returns a custom icon used to represent this handler.
%End
