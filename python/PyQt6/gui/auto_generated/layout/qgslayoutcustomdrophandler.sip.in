Abstract base class that may be implemented to handle new types of data to be dropped or pasted in QGIS layouts.

Constructor for QgsLayoutCustomDropHandler.

 virtual bool handleFileDrop( QgsLayoutDesignerInterface *iface, const QString &file ) /Deprecated="Since 3.40. Use the version which specifies a drop location instead."/;
%Docstring
Called when the specified ``file`` has been dropped onto a QGIS layout. If ``True``
is returned, then the handler has accepted this file and it should not
be further processed (e.g. by other QgsLayoutCustomDropHandler).

The base class implementation does nothing.

.. deprecated:: 3.40

   Use the version which specifies a drop location instead.
%End

    virtual bool handleFileDrop( QgsLayoutDesignerInterface *iface, QPointF dropPoint, const QString &file );
%Docstring
Called when the specified ``file`` has been dropped onto a QGIS layout. If ``True``
is returned, then the handler has accepted this file and it should not
be further processed (e.g. by other QgsLayoutCustomDropHandler).

The ``dropPoint`` point specifies the location (in layout coordinates) at which
the drop occurred.

The base class implementation does nothing.

%End

    virtual bool handlePaste( QgsLayoutDesignerInterface *iface, QPointF pastePoint, const QMimeData *data, QList<QgsLayoutItem *> &pastedItems /Out/ );
%Docstring
Called when the specified MIME ``data`` has been pasted onto a QGIS layout. If ``True``
is returned, then the handler has accepted this data and it should not
be further processed (e.g. by other QgsLayoutCustomDropHandler).

The ``pastePoint`` point specifies the location (in layout coordinates) at which
the paste occurred.

The base class implementation does nothing.

:param iface: pointer to the layout designer interface
:param pastePoint: layout point at which the paste should occur
:param data: MIME data to paste

:return: - ``True`` if the handler accepted and processed the paste operation
         - pastedItems: should be filled with any newly created items as a result of the paste
