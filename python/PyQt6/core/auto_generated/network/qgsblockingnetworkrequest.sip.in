class QgsBlockingNetworkRequest : QObject
{
%Docstring(signature="appended")
A thread safe class for performing blocking (sync) network requests, with full support for QGIS proxy
and authentication settings.

This class should be used whenever a blocking network request is required. Unlike implementations
which rely on QApplication.processEvents() or creation of a QEventLoop, this class is completely
thread safe and can be used on either the main thread or background threads without issue.

Redirects are automatically handled by the class.

After completion of a request, the reply content should be retrieved by calling :py:func:`~getReplyContent`.
This method returns a :py:class:`QgsNetworkReplyContent` container, which is safe and cheap to copy and pass
between threads without issue.

    ~QgsBlockingNetworkRequest();

    ErrorCode get( QNetworkRequest &request, bool forceRefresh = false, QgsFeedback *feedback = 0 );
%Docstring
Performs a "get" operation on the specified ``request``.

If ``forceRefresh`` is ``False`` then previously cached replies may be used for the request. If
it is set to ``True`` then a new query is always performed.

If an :py:func:`~QgsBlockingNetworkRequest.authCfg` has been set, then any authentication configuration required will automatically be applied to
``request``. There is no need to manually apply the authentication to the request prior to calling
this method.

The optional ``feedback`` argument can be used to abort ongoing requests.

The method will return NoError if the get operation was successful. The contents of the reply can be retrieved
by calling :py:func:`~QgsBlockingNetworkRequest.reply`.

If an error was encountered then a specific ErrorCode will be returned, and a detailed error message
can be retrieved by calling :py:func:`~QgsBlockingNetworkRequest.errorMessage`.

.. seealso:: :py:func:`post`
%End

    ErrorCode post( QNetworkRequest &request, QIODevice *data, bool forceRefresh = false, QgsFeedback *feedback = 0 );
%Docstring
Performs a "post" operation on the specified ``request``, using the given ``data``.

If ``forceRefresh`` is ``False`` then previously cached replies may be used for the request. If
it is set to ``True`` then a new query is always performed.

If an :py:func:`~QgsBlockingNetworkRequest.authCfg` has been set, then any authentication configuration required will automatically be applied to
