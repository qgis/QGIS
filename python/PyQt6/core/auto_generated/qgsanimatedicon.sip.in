class QgsAnimatedIcon : QObject

Animated icon is keeping an animation running if there are listeners connected to frameChanged
%End

  public:

    QgsAnimatedIcon( const QString &iconPath = QString(), QObject *parent = 0 );
%Docstring
Create a new animated icon. Optionally, the ``iconPath`` can already be specified.
%End

    QString iconPath() const;
%Docstring
Path to a movie, e.g. animated GIF
%End

    void setIconPath( const QString &iconPath );
%Docstring
Path to a movie, e.g. animated GIF
%End

    QIcon icon() const;
%Docstring
Gets the icons representation in the current frame.
This will need to be called repeatedly, whenever a :py:func:`~QgsAnimatedIcon.frameChanged`
signal is emitted.
%End


    bool connectFrameChanged( const QObject *receiver, const char *method );
%Docstring
Connect a slot that will be notified repeatedly whenever a frame changes and which should
request the current icon and trigger UI updates.

Connect to the frame changed signal with this method and not directly. This method
makes sure the annimation is started.
%End

    bool disconnectFrameChanged( const QObject *receiver, const char *method );
%Docstring
Convenience function to disconnect the same style that the frame change connection was established.
%End


    int width() const;
%Docstring
The native width of the icon.
%End

    int height() const;
%Docstring
The native height of the icon.
%End

  signals:

    void frameChanged();
%Docstring
Emitted when the icon changed. You should use connectFrameChanged instead of connecting
to this signal directly.
Connecting to this signal directly will cause the animation not to be started.
