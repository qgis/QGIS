class QgsMapLayerStyleManager : QObject
{
%Docstring(signature="appended")
Management of styles for use with one map layer

Stored styles are identified by their names. The manager
always keep track of which style of the stored ones is currently active. When the current style is changed,
the new style is applied to the associated layer.

The class takes care of updating itself when the layer's current style configuration changes.
When some of layer style's properties change (e.g. opacity / colors), the style manager will
record them in the currently active style without any extra effort required.

When an instance is created, it creates "default" style (with empty name) recorded from the associated map layer
and it is set as the current style. The instance must always contain at least one style (which is the current).

The style which is marked as current has no style data stored in its entry. This is to avoid duplication
of data as all data is stored in map layer and can be retrieved easily. Also when saving, the entry for
the current style will be saved with no data because everything is already saved by the map layer itself.

The class also features support for temporary change of the layer's style, ideal for short-term use of a custom
style followed by restoration of the original style (for example, when rendering a map with a different than current style).

Construct a style manager associated with a map layer (must not be ``None``).
The style manager will be parented to ``layer``.
%End

Gets pointer to the associated map layer
%End

%Docstring
Reset the style manager to a basic state - with one default style which is set as current

Read configuration (for project loading)

Write configuration (for project saving)
%End

Returns list of all defined style names

Gets available styles for the associated map layer.

:return: A map of map layer style by style name

%Docstring
Returns data of a stored style - accessed by its unique name
%End

%Docstring
Add a style with given name and data

:return: ``True`` on success (name is unique and style is valid)

%Docstring
Add style by cloning the current one

:return: ``True`` on success
%End

%Docstring
Remove a stored style

:return: ``True`` on success (style exists and it is not the last one)
%End

%Docstring
Rename a stored style to a different name

Returns name of the current style
%End

Set a different style as the current style - will apply it to the layer

:return: ``True`` on success
%End

%Docstring
Temporarily apply a different style to the layer. The argument
can be either a style name or a full QML style definition.
Each call must be paired with :py:func:`~QgsMapLayerStyleManager.restoreOverrideStyle`
%End

Restore the original store after a call to :py:func:`~QgsMapLayerStyleManager.setOverrideStyle`
