class QgsFeedback : QObject
{
%Docstring(signature="appended")
Base class for feedback objects to be used for cancellation of something running in a worker thread.

The class may be used as is or it may be subclassed for extended functionality
for a particular operation (e.g. report progress or pass some data for preview).

When :py:func:`~cancel` is called, the internal code has two options to check for cancellation state:

- if the worker thread uses an event loop (e.g. for network communication), the code can make a queued connection to :py:func:`~canceled` signal and handle the cancellation in its slot.
- if the worker thread does not use an event loop, it can poll :py:func:`~isCanceled` method regularly to see if the operation should be canceled.

The class is meant to be created and destroyed in the main thread.

For map rendering, the object may be created in constructor of a :py:class:`QgsMapLayerRenderer`
subclass and available with :py:func:`QgsMapLayerRenderer.feedback()` method. When a map rendering job
gets canceled, the :py:func:`~cancel` method is called on the feedback object of all layers.

Construct a feedback object

Sets the current progress for the feedback object. The ``progress``
argument is in percentage and valid values range from 0-100.

Returns the current progress reported by the feedback object. Depending on how the
feedback object is used progress reporting may not be supported. The returned value
is in percentage and ranges from 0-100.

Returns the current processed objects count reported by the feedback object. Depending on how the
feedback object is used processed count reporting may not be supported. The returned value
is an unsigned long integer and starts from 0.
