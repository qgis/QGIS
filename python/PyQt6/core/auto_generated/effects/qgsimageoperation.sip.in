class QgsImageOperation
{
%Docstring(signature="appended")
Contains operations and filters which apply to QImages

A set of optimised pixel manipulation operations and filters which can be applied
to QImages. All operations only apply to ARGB32 format images, and it is left up
to the calling procedure to ensure that any passed images are of the correct
format.

Operations are written to either modify an image in place or return a new image, depending
on which is faster for the particular operation.

    static void convertToGrayscale( QImage &image, GrayscaleMode mode = GrayscaleLuminosity, QgsFeedback *feedback = 0 );
%Docstring
Convert a QImage to a grayscale image. Alpha channel is preserved.

:param image: QImage to convert
:param mode: mode to use during grayscale conversion
:param feedback: optional feedback object for responsive cancellation (since QGIS 3.22)
%End

    static void adjustBrightnessContrast( QImage &image, int brightness, double contrast, QgsFeedback *feedback = 0 );
%Docstring
Alter the brightness or contrast of a QImage.

:param image: QImage to alter
:param brightness: brightness value, in the range -255 to 255. A brightness value of 0 indicates
                   no change to brightness, a negative value will darken the image, and a positive value will brighten
                   the image.
:param contrast: contrast value. Must be a positive or zero value. A value of 1.0 indicates no change
                 to the contrast, a value of 0 represents an image with 0 contrast, and a value > 1.0 will increase the
                 contrast of the image.
:param feedback: optional feedback object for responsive cancellation (since QGIS 3.22)

                                     double colorizeStrength = 1.0, QgsFeedback *feedback = 0 );
%Docstring
Alter the hue or saturation of a QImage.

:param image: QImage to alter
:param saturation: double between 0 and 2 inclusive, where 0 = desaturate and 1.0 = no change
:param colorizeColor: color to use for colorizing image. Set to an invalid QColor to disable
                      colorization.
:param colorizeStrength: double between 0 and 1, where 0 = no colorization and 1.0 = full colorization
:param feedback: optional feedback object for responsive cancellation (since QGIS 3.22)
%End

    static void multiplyOpacity( QImage &image, double factor, QgsFeedback *feedback = 0 );
%Docstring
Multiplies opacity of image pixel values by a factor.

:param image: QImage to alter
:param factor: factor to multiple pixel's opacity by
:param feedback: optional feedback object for responsive cancellation (since QGIS 3.22)
%End

    static void overlayColor( QImage &image, const QColor &color );
%Docstring
Overlays a color onto an image. This operation retains the alpha channel of the
original image, but replaces all image pixel colors with the specified color.

:param image: QImage to alter
:param color: color to overlay (any alpha component of the color is ignored)
%End

    static void distanceTransform( QImage &image, const QgsImageOperation::DistanceTransformProperties &properties, QgsFeedback *feedback = 0 );
%Docstring
Performs a distance transform on the source image and shades the result
using a color ramp.

:param image: QImage to alter
:param properties: DistanceTransformProperties object with parameters
                   for the distance transform operation
:param feedback: optional feedback object for responsive cancellation (since QGIS 3.22)
%End

    static void stackBlur( QImage &image, int radius, bool alphaOnly = false, QgsFeedback *feedback = 0 );
%Docstring
Performs a stack blur on an image. Stack blur represents a good balance between
speed and blur quality.

:param image: QImage to blur
:param radius: blur radius in pixels, maximum value of 16
:param alphaOnly: set to ``True`` to blur only the alpha component of the image
:param feedback: optional feedback object for responsive cancellation (since QGIS 3.22)

.. note::

   for fastest operation, ensure the source image is ARGB32_Premultiplied if
   alphaOnly is set to ``False``, or ARGB32 if alphaOnly is ``True``
%End

    static QImage *gaussianBlur( QImage &image, int radius, QgsFeedback *feedback = 0 ) /Factory/;
%Docstring
Performs a gaussian blur on an image. Gaussian blur is slower but results in a high
quality blur.

:param image: QImage to blur
:param radius: blur radius in pixels
:param feedback: optional feedback object for responsive cancellation (since QGIS 3.22)

:return: blurred image

.. note::

   for fastest operation, ensure the source image is ARGB32_Premultiplied
%End

    static void flipImage( QImage &image, FlipType type );
%Docstring
Flips an image horizontally or vertically

:param image: QImage to flip
:param type: type of flip to perform (horizontal or vertical)
%End

    static QRect nonTransparentImageRect( const QImage &image, QSize minSize = QSize(), bool center = false );
%Docstring
Calculates the non-transparent region of an image.

:param image: source image
:param minSize: minimum size for returned region, if desired. If the
                non-transparent region of the image is smaller than this minimum size,
                it will be centered in the returned rectangle.
:param center: return rectangle will be centered on the center of the original image if set to ``True``

.. seealso:: :py:func:`cropTransparent`

.. versionadded:: 2.9
%End

    static QImage cropTransparent( const QImage &image, QSize minSize = QSize(), bool center = false );
%Docstring
Crop any transparent border from around an image.

:param image: source image
:param minSize: minimum size for cropped image, if desired. If the
                cropped image is smaller than the minimum size, it will be centered
                in the returned image.
:param center: cropped image will be centered on the center of the original image if set to ``True``
