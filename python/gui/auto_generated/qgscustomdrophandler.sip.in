class QgsCustomDropHandler : QObject
{
%Docstring
Abstract base class that may be implemented to handle new types of data to be dropped in QGIS.

Implementations have three approaches they can use to handle drops.

# The simplest approach is to implement :py:func:`~handeFileDrop` when they need to handle
  dropped files (i.e. with mime type "text/uri-list").
# Reimplement :py:func:`~handleCustomUriDrop` when they want to handle dropped custom
  QgsMimeDataUtils.Uri entries, for instance handling dropping custom entries
  from the browser tree (with mime type "application/x-vnd.qgis.qgis.uri"). In
  this case the implementation's :py:func:`~customUriProviderKey` must match the uri
  entry's providerKey.
# Reimplement :py:func:`~handleMimeData` to directly handle dropped QMimeData.
  Subclasses should take care when overriding this method. When a drop event
  occurs, Qt will lock the source application of the drag for the duration
  of the drop event handling via :py:func:`~handleMimeData` (e.g. dragging files from
  explorer to QGIS will lock the explorer window until the drop handling has
  been complete). Accordingly :py:func:`~handleMimeData` implementations must return
  quickly and defer any intensive or slow processing.

.. versionadded:: 3.0
%End

%TypeHeaderCode
#include "qgscustomdrophandler.h"
%End
  public:

    virtual QString customUriProviderKey() const;
%Docstring
Type of custom URI recognized by the handler. This must match
the URI entry's providerKey in order for :py:func:`~QgsCustomDropHandler.handleCustomUriDrop`
to be called.

.. seealso:: :py:func:`handleCustomUriDrop`
%End

    virtual void handleCustomUriDrop( const QgsMimeDataUtils::Uri &uri ) const;
%Docstring
Called from QGIS after a drop event with custom URI known by the handler.

In order for :py:func:`~QgsCustomDropHandler.handleCustomUriDrop` to be called, subclasses must
also implement :py:func:`~QgsCustomDropHandler.customUriProviderKey` to indicate the providerKey
value which the handler accepts.

.. seealso:: :py:func:`customUriProviderKey`
%End

    virtual bool canHandleMimeData( const QMimeData *data );
%Docstring
Returns ``True`` if the handler is capable of handling the provided mime ``data``.
The base class implementation returns ``False`` regardless of mime data.

This method is called when mime data is dragged over the QGIS window, in order
to determine whether any handlers are capable of handling the data and to
determine whether the drag action should be accepted.

.. versionadded:: 3.10
%End


 virtual void handleMimeData( const QMimeData *data ) /Deprecated/;
%Docstring
Called when the specified mime ``data`` has been dropped onto QGIS.

The base class implementation does nothing.

Subclasses should take care when overriding this method. When a drop event
occurs, Qt will lock the source application of the drag for the duration
of the drop event handling (e.g. dragging files from explorer to QGIS will
lock the explorer window until the drop handling has been complete).

Accordingly, only implementations must be lightweight and return ASAP.
(For instance by copying the relevant parts of ``data`` and then handling
the data after a short timeout).

.. deprecated:: QGIS 3.10
   - use handleMimeDataV2() instead.
%End

    virtual bool handleMimeDataV2( const QMimeData *data );
%Docstring
Called when the specified mime ``data`` has been dropped onto QGIS.

The base class implementation does nothing.

Subclasses should take care when overriding this method. When a drop event
occurs, Qt will lock the source application of the drag for the duration
of the drop event handling (e.g. dragging files from explorer to QGIS will
lock the explorer window until the drop handling has been complete).

Accordingly, only implementations must be lightweight and return ASAP.
(For instance by copying the relevant parts of ``data`` and then handling
the data after a short timeout).

If the function returns ``True``, it means the handler has accepted the drop
and it should not be further processed (e.g. by other QgsCustomDropHandlers)

.. versionadded:: 3.10
%End

    virtual bool handleFileDrop( const QString &file );
%Docstring
Called when the specified ``file`` has been dropped onto QGIS. If ``True``
is returned, then the handler has accepted this file and it should not
be further processed (e.g. by other QgsCustomDropHandlers).

The base class implementation does nothing.

This method is not called directly while drop handling is occurring,
so the limitations described in :py:func:`~QgsCustomDropHandler.handleMimeData` about returning
quickly do not apply.
%End

    virtual bool canHandleCustomUriCanvasDrop( const QgsMimeDataUtils::Uri &uri, QgsMapCanvas *canvas );
%Docstring
Returns ``True`` if the handler is capable of handling the provided mime ``uri``
when dropped onto a map ``canvas``.

The base class implementation returns ``False`` regardless of mime data.

This method is called when mime data is dragged over a map canvas, in order
to determine whether any handlers are capable of handling the data and to
determine whether the drag action should be accepted.

.. warning::

   Subclasses should be very careful about implementing this. If they
   incorrectly return ``True`` to a ``uri``, it will prevent the default application
   drop handling from occurring and will break the ability to drag and drop layers
   and files onto QGIS.

.. versionadded:: 3.10
%End

    virtual bool handleCustomUriCanvasDrop( const QgsMimeDataUtils::Uri &uri, QgsMapCanvas *canvas ) const;
%Docstring
Called from QGIS after a drop event with custom ``uri`` known by the handler occurs
onto a map ``canvas``.

In order for :py:func:`~QgsCustomDropHandler.handleCustomUriCanvasDrop` to be called, subclasses must
also implement :py:func:`~QgsCustomDropHandler.customUriProviderKey` to indicate the providerKey
value which the handler accepts.

If the function returns ``True``, it means the handler has accepted the drop
and it should not be further processed (e.g. by other QgsCustomDropHandlers).

Subclasses which implement this must also implement corresponding versions of
:py:func:`~QgsCustomDropHandler.canHandleCustomUriCanvasDrop`.
