class QgsMapToolAdvancedDigitizing : QgsMapToolEdit
{
%Docstring(signature="appended")
The :py:class:`QgsMapToolAdvancedDigitizing` class is a :py:class:`QgsMapTool` which gives event directly in map coordinates and allows filtering its events.
Events from :py:class:`QgsMapTool` are caught and their QMouseEvent are transformed into :py:class:`QgsMapMouseEvent` (with map coordinates).
Events are then forwarded to corresponding virtual methods which can be reimplemented in subclasses.
An event filter can be set on the map tool to filter and modify the events in map coordinates (:py:class:`QgsMapToolMapEventFilter`).

.. note::

   at the moment, the event filter is used by the CAD tools (:py:class:`QgsCadDocWidget`).

.. note::

   the event filter definition is not exposed in Python API to avoid any unexpected behavior.

    explicit QgsMapToolAdvancedDigitizing( QgsMapCanvas *canvas, QgsAdvancedDigitizingDockWidget *cadDockWidget );
%Docstring
Creates an advanced digitizing maptool

:param canvas: The map canvas on which the tool works
:param cadDockWidget: The cad dock widget which will be used to adjust mouse events
%End

    virtual void canvasPressEvent( QgsMapMouseEvent *e );

%Docstring
Catch the mouse press event, filters it, transforms it to map coordinates and send it to virtual method

%Docstring
Catch the mouse release event, filters it, transforms it to map coordinates and send it to virtual method
%End

%Docstring
Catch the mouse move event, filters it, transforms it to map coordinates and send it to virtual method

Registers this maptool with the cad dock widget

Unregisters this maptool from the cad dock widget

    QgsAdvancedDigitizingDockWidget *cadDockWidget() const;

    virtual QgsMapLayer *layer() const;
%Docstring
Returns the layer associated with the map tool.

By default this returns the map canvas' :py:func:`QgsMapCanvas.currentLayer()`.

.. versionadded:: 3.22
%End

    bool isAdvancedDigitizingAllowed() const;
%Docstring
Returns whether functionality of advanced digitizing dock widget is currently allowed.

Tools may decide to switch this support on/off based on the current state of the map tool.
For example, in vertex tool before user picks a vertex to move, advanced digitizing dock
widget should be disabled and only enabled once a vertex is being moved. Other map tools
may keep advanced digitizing allowed all the time.

If ``True`` is returned, that does not mean that advanced digitizing is actually active,
because it is up to the user to enable/disable it when it is allowed.
\sa :py:func:`~QgsMapToolAdvancedDigitizing.setAdvancedDigitizingAllowed`

.. versionadded:: 3.0
%End

    bool isAutoSnapEnabled() const;
%Docstring
Returns whether mouse events (press/move/release) should automatically try to snap mouse position
(according to the snapping configuration of map canvas) before passing the mouse coordinates
to the tool. This may be desirable default behavior for some map tools, but not for other map tools.
It is therefore possible to configure the behavior by the map tool.
\sa :py:func:`~QgsMapToolAdvancedDigitizing.isAutoSnapEnabled`

.. versionadded:: 3.0
%End

  protected:

    void setAdvancedDigitizingAllowed( bool allowed );
%Docstring
Sets whether functionality of advanced digitizing dock widget is currently allowed.
This method is protected because it should be a decision of the map tool and not from elsewhere.

.. versionadded:: 3.0

construction mode.

Override this method when subclassing this class.

Enables or disables snap to grid of mouse events.
The snapping will occur in the layer's CRS.
