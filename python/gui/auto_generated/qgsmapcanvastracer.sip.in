class QgsMapCanvasTracer : QgsTracer
{
%Docstring
Extension of QgsTracer that provides extra functionality:
- automatic updates of own configuration based on canvas settings
- reporting of issues to the user via message bar
- determines whether tracing is currently enabled by the user

A simple registry of tracer instances associated to map canvas instances
is kept for convenience. (Map tools do not need to create their local
tracer instances and map canvas API is not "polluted" by this optional
functionality).

.. versionadded:: 2.14

%TypeHeaderCode
#include "qgsmapcanvastracer.h"
%End
  public:
    explicit QgsMapCanvasTracer( QgsMapCanvas *canvas, QgsMessageBar *messageBar = 0 );
%Docstring
Create tracer associated with a particular map canvas, optionally message bar for reporting
%End
    ~QgsMapCanvasTracer();

    QAction *actionEnableTracing() const;
%Docstring
Access to action that user may use to toggle tracing on/off. May be null if no action was associated
%End

    void setActionEnableTracing( QAction *action );
%Docstring
Assign "enable tracing" checkable action to the tracer.
The action is used to determine whether tracing is currently enabled by the user
%End

    QAction *actionEnableSnapping() const;
%Docstring

%Docstring
Retrieve instance of this class associated with given canvas (if any).
The class keeps a simple registry of tracers associated with map canvas
instances for easier access to the common tracer by various map tools
%End

%Docstring
Report a path finding error to the user
%End
