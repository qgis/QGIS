    %Preventing figures from appearing on a page by themselves.

    % LaTeX's figure placement algorithm is quite biased in favour of putting figures on a page by themselves, instead of on the top of a page with some text below it.  Often, I find the result aesthetically unappealing (to be polite).  Fortunately, the parameters of the algorithm can be changed.  The main problem is that LaTeX per default only allows a part of the top of a text-page (70%) to contain figures, and requires at least 20% of a page to be text when text and figures share a page.  These parameters should be set to more reasonable values, for example 85% and 10%.
    \renewcommand{\topfraction}{0.85}
    \renewcommand{\textfraction}{0.1}

    %  This helps, but sometimes LaTeX puts a figure on a page by itself, although it would fit perfectly well on the top of a page.  This happens when the figure will not fit on the page where it was defined.  LaTeX then attempts to put it on a figures-only page before it attempts to put it at the top of the next page.  A page may contain figures alone if the figure(s) use at least half the page.  To prevent half-empty pages this limit should probably be increased to around 75%.
    \renewcommand{\floatpagefraction}{0.75}

    %    Be careful not to make \floatpagefraction larger than \topfraction, then you risk to produce a figure that can neither go on the top of a text page, nor on a page by itself.  If that happens, the figure and all later figures will be postponed until next time a \clearpage is executed (typically at the end of a chapter or the end of the document).  This will also happen if a figure is too large to fit on a page.
