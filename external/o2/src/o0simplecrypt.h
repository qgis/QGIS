/**
  @short Simple encryption and decryption of strings and byte arrays

  This class provides a simple implementation of encryption and decryption
  of strings and byte arrays.

  @warning The encryption provided by this class is NOT strong encryption. It may
  help to shield things from curious eyes, but it will NOT stand up to someone
  determined to break the encryption. Don't say you were not warned.

  The class uses a 64 bit key. Simply create an instance of the class, set the key,
  and use the encryptToString() method to calculate an encrypted version of the input string.
  To decrypt that string again, use an instance of SimpleCrypt initialized with
  the same key, and call the decryptToString() method with the encrypted string. If the key
  matches, the decrypted version of the string will be returned again.

  If you do not provide a key, or if something else is wrong, the encryption and
  decryption function will return an empty string or will return a string containing nonsense.
  lastError() will return a value indicating if the method was succesful, and if not, why not.

  SimpleCrypt is prepared for the case that the encryption and decryption
  algorithm is changed in a later version, by prepending a version identifier to the cypertext.
