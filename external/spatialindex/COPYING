Licensing History
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


.. note::
    libspatialindex changed from a `LGPL`_ to a `MIT`_ license as of the 1.8.0
    release. For most situations, this should have no impact on the library's
    use, but it should open it up for usage in situations that otherwise might
    have been problematic. Versions of libspatialindex prior to 1.8.0 were
    licensed LGPL 2.0, with the license description on this file. The codebase
    has been been updated, with licensing information replaced in headers and
    source files, to use the MIT license as of the 1.8.0+ release.
    
    This change was made to support the inclusion of software depending on 
    libspatialindex in static linking-only environments such as embedded systems 
    and Apple's iOS. libspatialindex versions prior to 1.8.0 will continue to 
    live on as LGPL software, and developers can continue to contribute to them 
    under terms of that license, but the main development effort, and ongoing 
    maintenance, releases, and bug applications, will move forward using the 
    new MIT license at http://github.com/libspatialindex/libspatialindex
