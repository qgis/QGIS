Description: Geographic Information System (GIS)
 A Geographic Information System (GIS) manages,
 analyzes, and displays databases of geographic
 information. Quantum GIS (QGIS) supports shapefile
 viewing and editing, spatial data storage with
 PostgreSQL/PostGIS, projection on-the-fly, map
 composition, and a number of other features via
 a plugin interface. QGIS also supports display
 of various georeferenced raster and Digital
 Elevation Model (DEM) formats including
 GeoTIFF, Arc/Info ASCII Grid, and USGS ASCII DEM.
