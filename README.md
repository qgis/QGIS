### 2. Beautiful cartography
- Large variety of rendering options in 2D and 3D
- Fine control over symbology, labeling, legends and additional graphical elements for beautifully rendered maps

- In particular, near-complete replication (and significant extension) of symbology options that are available in proprietary software by ESRI
- Advanced styling using data-defined overrides, blending modes, and draw effects
- 500+ built-in color ramps (cpt-city, ColorBrewer, etc.)
- Create and update maps with specified scale, extent, style, and decorations via saved layouts
- Generate multiple maps (and reports) automatically using QGIS Atlas and QGIS Reports
- Display and export elevation profile plots with flexible symbology
- Flexible output direct to printer, or as image (raster), PDF, or SVG for further customization
- On-the-fly rendering enhancements using geometry generators (e.g. create and style new geometries from existing features)
- Preview modes for inclusive map making (e.g. monochrome, color blindness)

### 5. QGIS Server

Headless map server -- running on Linux, macOS, Windows, or in a docker container -- that shares the same code base as QGIS.

- Industry-standard protocols (WMS, WFS, WFS3/OGC API for Features and WCS) allow plug-n-play with any software stack
- Works with any web server (Apache, nginx, etc) or standalone
- All beautiful QGIS cartography is supported with best-in-class support for printing
- Fully customizable with Python scripting support

## Under the hood

QGIS is developed using the [Qt toolkit](https://qt.io) and C++, since 2002, and has a pleasing, easy to use graphical
user interface with multilingual support. It is maintained by an active developer team and supported by vibrant
community of GIS professionals and enthusiasts as well as geospatial data publishers and end-users.

### Versions and release cycle

QGIS development and releases follow a [time based schedule/roadmap](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html). There are three main branches of QGIS that users can install. These are the **Long Term Release (LTR)** branch, the **Latest Release (LR)** branch, and the **Development (Nightly)** branch.

Every month, there is a **Point Release** that provides bug-fixes to the LTR and LR.

### Free and Open Source

QGIS is released under the GNU Public License (GPL) Version 2 or any later version.
Developing QGIS under this license means that you can (if you want to) inspect
and modify the source code and guarantees that you, our happy user will always
have access to a GIS program that is free of cost and can be freely
modified.

QGIS is part of the Open-Source Geospatial Foundation ([OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/)), offering a range of complementary open-source GIS software projects.

## Installing and using QGIS

Precompiled binaries for QGIS are available at [the QGIS.org download page](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html).
Please follow the installation instructions carefully.

The [building guide](INSTALL.md) can be used to get started with building QGIS from source.

For installation of QGIS Server, see its [getting started documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/server_manual/getting_started.html).

- Joining the [qgis-users mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-user)
- Chatting with other users real-time. *Please wait around for a response to your question as many folks on the channel are doing other things and it may take a while for them to notice your question. The following paths all take you to the same chat room:*
    - Using an IRC client and joining the
      [#qgis](https://web.libera.chat/?channels=#qgis) channel on irc.libera.chat.
    - Using a Matrix client and joining the [#qgis:osgeo.org](https://matrix.to/#/#qgis:osgeo.org) room.
 - At the [GIS stackexchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/) or [r/QGIS reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/QGIS/), which are not maintained by the QGIS team, but where the QGIS and broader GIS community provides lots of advice
- [Other support channels](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/support.html)

## Get involved with the community

### Bug reporting and bug fixing

You can help us **by submitting bug reports or fixing bugs** in the [QGIS bug tracker](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/).

### New features and enhancements

If you wish to contribute patches you can:

1. [fork the project](https://help.github.com/forking/)
1. make your changes
1. commit to your repository
1. and then [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).

 The development team can then review your contribution and commit it upstream as appropriate.

If you commit a new feature, add `[FEATURE]` to your commit message AND give a clear description of the new feature. The label `Needs documentation` will be added by maintainers and will automatically create an issue on the QGIS-Documentation repo, where you or others should write documentation about it.

For large-scale changes, you can open a [QEP (QGIS Enhancement Proposal)](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals). QEPs are used in the process of creating and discussing new enhancements or policy for QGIS.

### Translations

Please help translate QGIS to your language. At this moment about forty languages are already available in the Desktop user interface and about eighty languages are available in transifex ready to be translated.

The [translation](https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/translate.html) process is managed by the [Translation Team](https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/governance/governance.html#gui-translation) and all the activities are done under the [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/qgis/) platform.

### Other ways to contribute

If you are not a developer, there are many other possibilities that do not require programming skills to help QGIS to evolve. Check our [project homepage for more information](https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/index.html).
