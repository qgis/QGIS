Help I think I found a bug
---------------------------

If you find a bug in QGIS, first check if it has already been reported:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues

If you can't find an existing ticket, report a new one, using the bug report template provided.

Some hints about when you should file a bug:


 - Just because a bug is filed doesn't always mean we can or will fix it.
   Sometimes people ask for things that will require many man hours to do and
   offer little reward to work ratio benefit when compared to the other issues
   in the queue. Also some things are simply not fixable due to whatever
   technical reason.
 - Sometimes we don't fix a bug because the user's vision of how QGIS should
   behave doesn't match ours. Hey we are all humans it can happen...
 - Always check that your bug has not already been filed by someone else since
   dealing with duplicate tickets causes a lot of time wasting.
 - Be prepared to provided further feedback after the initial triage.
 - Don't be offended if we don't see tickets as having the same priority as you
   do. While we appreciate it's inconvenient if some issue prevents you doing
   your work, we need to take the big picture view of things and focus on
   things that affect the largest proportion of our user base.
