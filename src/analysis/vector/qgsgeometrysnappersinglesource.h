/**
 * \ingroup analysis
 *
 * \brief Makes sure that any two vertices of the vector layer are at least at distance given by the threshold value.
 *
 * The algorithm moves nearby vertices to one location and adds vertices to segments that are passing around other
 * vertices within the threshold. It does not remove any vertices. Also, it does not modify geometries unless
 * needed (it does not snap coordinates to a grid).
 *
 * This algorithm comes handy when doing vector overlay operations such as intersection, union or difference
 * to prevent possible topological errors caused by numerical errors if coordinates are very close to each other.
 *
 * After running the algorithm some previously valid geometries may become invalid and therefore it may be useful
 * to run Fix geometries algorithm afterwards.
 *
 * \note Originally ported from GRASS implementation of Vect_snap_lines_list()
 *
 * \since QGIS 3.4
