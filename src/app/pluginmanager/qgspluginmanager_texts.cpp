Plugins in this list here are <b>broken or incompatible</b> with your version of QGIS.\
</p>\
\
<p>\
Click on an individual plugin; if possible QGIS shows you more information.\
</p>\
\
<p>\
The main reasons to have invalid plugins is that this plugin is not build \
for this version of QGIS. Maybe you can download another version from <a href=\"https://plugins.qgis.org\">plugins.qgis.org</a>.\
</p>\
\
<p>\
Another common reason is that a python plugin needs some external python libraries (dependencies). \
You can install them yourself, depending on your operating system. After a correct \
install the plugin should work.\
