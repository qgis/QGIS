/**
 * \ingroup core
 *
 * \brief Tile download manager handles downloads of map tiles for the purpose of map rendering.
 * The purpose of this class is to handle a couple of situations that may happen:
 *
 * - a map rendering job starts which requests tiles from a remote server, then in a short
 *   while user zooms/pans map, which would normally mean that all pending requests get
 *   aborted and then restarted soon afterwards. The download manager allows the requests
 *   to finish to avoid excessive load on servers and needless aborts and repeated requests.
 * - multiple map rendering jobs start at a similar time, requesting the same map tiles.
 *   Normally they could be requested multiple times from the server - the download manager
 *   groups these requests and only does a single request at a time.
 *
 * At this point, it is not recommended to use this class for other scenarios than map
 * rendering: using it elsewhere could slow down map rendering or have some unexpected
 * negative effects.
 *
 * How do things work:
 *
 * - Upon a request, a QgsTileDownloadManagerReply object (based on QObject) is returned,
 *   encapsulating the pending reply. Client can wait for its finished() signal - when
 *   it gets emitted, the request has finished with success or failure. Client can delete
 *   the reply object before the request is processed - download manager will finish its
 *   download (and it will get cached for a future use).
 * - All requests are done by QgsNetworkAccessManager
 * - A worker thread responsible for all network tile requests is started first time a tile
 *   is requested. Having a dedicated thread rather than reusing main thread makes things
 *   more predictable as we won't get stuck in case the main thread is doing some work or
 *   it is waiting for map rendering to finish.
 * - There is a shared download queue (protected by a mutex) with a list of active requests
 *   and requests waiting to be processed.
 * - Added in QGIS 3.26: If the request is an HTTP range request, the data may be cached
 *   into a local directory using QgsRangeRequestCache to avoid requesting the same data
 *   excessively. Caching will be disabled for requests with CacheLoadControlAttribute set
 *   to AlwaysNetwork or CacheSaveControlAttribute set to false
 *
