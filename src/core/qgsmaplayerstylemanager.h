/**
 * \ingroup core
 * \brief Management of styles for use with one map layer.
 *
 * Stored styles are identified by their names. The manager
 * always keep track of which style of the stored ones is currently active. When the current style is changed,
 * the new style is applied to the associated layer.
 *
 * The class takes care of updating itself when the layer's current style configuration changes.
 * When some of layer style's properties change (e.g. opacity / colors), the style manager will
 * record them in the currently active style without any extra effort required.
 *
 * When an instance is created, it creates "default" style (with empty name) recorded from the associated map layer
 * and it is set as the current style. The instance must always contain at least one style (which is the current).
 *
 * The style which is marked as current has no style data stored in its entry. This is to avoid duplication
 * of data as all data is stored in map layer and can be retrieved easily. Also when saving, the entry for
 * the current style will be saved with no data because everything is already saved by the map layer itself.
 *
 * The class also features support for temporary change of the layer's style, ideal for short-term use of a custom
 * style followed by restoration of the original style (for example, when rendering a map with a different than current style).
