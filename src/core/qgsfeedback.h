/**
 * \ingroup core
 * \brief Base class for feedback objects to be used for cancellation of something running in a worker thread.
 *
 * The class may be used as is or it may be subclassed for extended functionality
 * for a particular operation (e.g. report progress or pass some data for preview).
 *
 * When cancel() is called, the internal code has two options to check for cancellation state:
 *
 * - if the worker thread uses an event loop (e.g. for network communication), the code can make a queued connection to canceled() signal and handle the cancellation in its slot.
 * - if the worker thread does not use an event loop, it can poll isCanceled() method regularly to see if the operation should be canceled.
 *
 * The class is meant to be created and destroyed in the main thread.
 *
 * For map rendering, the object may be created in constructor of a QgsMapLayerRenderer
 * subclass and available with QgsMapLayerRenderer::feedback() method. When a map rendering job
 * gets canceled, the cancel() method is called on the feedback object of all layers.
 *
