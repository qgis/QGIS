 * \class QgsAbstractValidityCheck

 * \brief Abstract base class for individual validity checks.
 *
 * Validity checks represent objects which can run a test using a QgsValidityCheckContext, and return
 * the results of the check via QgsValidityCheckResult objects.
 *
 * Checks can be used for many different use cases, e.g. validating a layout's contents before allowing
 * an export to occur, or validating the contents of a Processing model (and warning if required plugin based
 * providers are not available or if compulsory algorithm parameters have not been populated).
 *
 * Subclasses must indicate the type of check they represent via the checkType() method. When checks are performed,
 * all the registered checks with a matching check type are performed sequentially. The check type also
 * dictates the subclass of the QgsValidityCheckContext which is given to the subclass' runCheck method.
 *
 * Checks must be registered in the application's QgsValidityCheckRegistry, which is accessible via
 * QgsApplication::validityCheckRegistry().
 *
 * \see QgsValidityCheckRegistry
