 *
 * This class provides abstraction of a dialog for requesting credentials to the user.
 * By default QgsCredentials will be used if not overridden with other
 * credential creator function.

 * QGIS application uses QgsCredentialDialog class for displaying a dialog to the user.

 * Caller can use the mutex to synchronize authentications to avoid requesting
 * credentials for the same resource several times.

 * Object deletes itself when it's not needed anymore. Children should use
 * signal destroyed() to be notified of the deletion
