     * a fixed tolerance, this version adjusts the tolerance based on the radius size.
     *
     * Mathematical approach:
     *     1. Compute adaptive tolerance that varies with radius:

     * sqrt(radius) provides basic scaling
     * log10(radius + 1) dampens the scaling for large radii
     *
     *     2. Apply sagitta-based calculation:
     *
     * Calculate angle = 2 * arccos(1 - adaptive_tolerance/radius)

     * Calculate the number of segments based on the maximum allowed area error.
     *
     * This function computes the minimum number of segments needed to approximate
     * a circle with a regular polygon such that the relative area error between
     * the polygonal approximation and the actual circle is less than the specified tolerance.
     *
     * Mathematical derivation:
     *     1. Area ratio between a regular n-sided polygon and a circle:
     *        Circle area: Ac = œÄr¬≤
     *        Regular polygon area: Ap = (nr¬≤/2) * sin(2œÄ/n)
     *        Ratio = Ap / Ac = (n / 2œÄ) * sin(2œÄ/n)
     *
     *     2. For relative error E:
     *        E = |1 - Ap / Ac| = |1 - (n / 2œÄ) * sin(2œÄ/n)|
     *
     *     3. Using Taylor series approximation for sin(x) when x is small:
     *        sin(x) ‚âà x - x¬≥ / 6
     *        With x = 2œÄ / n:
     *            sin(2œÄ / n) ‚âà (2œÄ / n) - (2œÄ / n)¬≥ / 6
     *
     *     4. Substituting and simplifying:
     *        E ‚âà |1 - (n / 2œÄ) * ((2œÄ / n) - (2œÄ / n)¬≥ / 6)|
     *        E ‚âà |1 - (1 - (2œÄ¬≤ / 3n¬≤))|
     *        E ‚âà 2œÄ¬≤ / 3n¬≤
     *
     *     5. Rearranging to find the minimum n for a given tolerance:
     *        Start with the inequality: E ‚â§ tolerance
     *        Substitute the expression for E:
     *          2œÄ¬≤ / 3n¬≤ ‚â§ tolerance
     *        Rearrange to isolate n¬≤:
     *          n¬≤ ‚â• 2œÄ¬≤ / (3 * tolerance)
     *        Taking the square root:
     *          n ‚â• œÄ * sqrt(2 / (3 * tolerance))
