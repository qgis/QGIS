/**
 * \ingroup gui
 * \brief Abstract base class that may be implemented to handle new types of data to be dropped in QGIS.
 *
 * Implementations have three approaches they can use to handle drops.
 *
 * - The simplest approach is to implement handleFileDrop() when they need to handle
 *   dropped files (i.e. with mime type "text/uri-list").
 * - Reimplement handleCustomUriDrop() when they want to handle dropped custom
 *   QgsMimeDataUtils::Uri entries, for instance handling dropping custom entries
 *   from the browser tree (with mime type "application/x-vnd.qgis.qgis.uri"). In
 *   this case the implementation's customUriProviderKey() must match the uri
 *   entry's providerKey.
 * - Reimplement handleMimeData() to directly handle dropped QMimeData.
 *   Subclasses should take care when overriding this method. When a drop event
 *   occurs, Qt will lock the source application of the drag for the duration
 *   of the drop event handling via handleMimeData() (e.g. dragging files from
 *   explorer to QGIS will lock the explorer window until the drop handling has
 *   been complete). Accordingly handleMimeData() implementations must return
 *   quickly and defer any intensive or slow processing.
 *
