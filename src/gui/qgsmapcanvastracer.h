 * This tracer subclass adds:
 *
 * - automatic updates of own configuration based on canvas settings
 * - reporting of issues to the user via message bar
 * - determines whether tracing is currently enabled by the user
 *
 * A simple registry of tracer instances associated to map canvas instances
 * is kept for convenience. (Map tools do not need to create their local
 * tracer instances and map canvas API is not "polluted" by this optional
 * functionality).
