/**
 * \ingroup gui
 * \brief The QgsMapToolAdvancedDigitizing class is a QgsMapTool which gives event directly in map coordinates and allows filtering its events.
 * Events from QgsMapTool are caught and their QMouseEvent are transformed into QgsMapMouseEvent (with map coordinates).
 * Events are then forwarded to corresponding virtual methods which can be reimplemented in subclasses.
 * An event filter can be set on the map tool to filter and modify the events in map coordinates (\see QgsMapToolMapEventFilter).
 * \note at the moment, the event filter is used by the CAD tools (\see QgsCadDocWidget).
 * \note the event filter definition is not exposed in Python API to avoid any unexpected behavior.
