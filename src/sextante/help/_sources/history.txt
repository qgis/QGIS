The SEXTANTE history
====================

Every time you execute a SEXTANTE algorithm, information about the
process is stored in the SEXTANTE history manager. Along with the
parameters used, the date and time of the execution are also saved.

This way, it is easy to track the and control all the work that has been
developed using SEXTANTE, and easily reproduce it.

The SEXTANTE history manager is a set of registry entries grouped
according to their date of execution, making it easier to find
information about an algorithm executed at any particular moment.

Process information is kept as a command-line expression, even if the
algorithm was launched from the toolbox. This makes it also useful for
those learning how to use the command-line interface, since they can call
an algorithm using the toolbox and then check the history manager to see
how that same algorithm could be called from the command line.

Apart from browsing the entries in the registry, processes can be
re-executed, simply double-clicking on the corresponding entry.

Along with algorithm executions, SEXTANTE communicates with the user
using the other groups of the registry, namely *Errors, Warnings* and
*Information*. In case something is not working properly, having a look
at the *Errors* might help you to see what is happening. If you get in
contact with a SEXTANTE developer to report a bug or error, the
information in that group will be very useful for him to find out what
is going wrong.

When executing third party algorithms, this is usually done calling
their command-line interfaces, which communicate with the user using the
console. Although that console is not shown, a full dump of it is stored
in the *Information* group each time you run one of those algorithms.
If, for instance, you are having problems executing a SAGA algorithm,
look for an entry name *SAGA execution console output* to check all the
messages generated by SAGA and try to find out where the problem is.

Some algorithms, even if they can produce a result with the given input
data, might add comments or additional information to *Warning* in case
they detect potential problems from that data, in order to warn you
about them. Make sure you check those messages in case you are having
unexpected results.
