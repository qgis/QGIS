<h3>Print Composer</h3>

<p>
The print composer lets you arrange items onto a page, which can then be printed. Items include the content of the map canvas, the scale bar, the legend, and arbituary images.
</p>

<p>
Click on one of the icons along the top of the composer window to select what type of item to place on the page, then click and draw on the page to place the item. The size of some items, such as the map canvas and scale bar can be set by clicking and dragging on the page. Other items have a fixed size, but which can be changed later on by highlighting the item and then adjusting the size fields in the left hand pane.
