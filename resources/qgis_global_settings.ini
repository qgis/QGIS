# Desired parity checking mode for serial port GPS connections
# "NoParity" - No parity bit it sent. This is the most common parity setting. Error detection is handled by the communication protocol.
# "EvenParity" - The number of 1 bits in each character, including the parity bit, is always even.
# "OddParity" - The number of 1 bits in each character, including the parity bit, is always odd. It ensures that at least one state transition occurs in each character.
# "SpaceParity" - Space parity. The parity bit is sent in the space signal condition. It does not provide error detection information.
# "MarkParity" - Mark parity. The parity bit is always set to the mark signal condition (logical 1). It does not provide error detection information.

# Desired data bits in a frame for serial port GPS connections
# "Data5" - The number of data bits in each character is 5. It is used for Baudot code. It generally only makes sense with older equipment such as teleprinters.
# "Data6" - The number of data bits in each character is 6. It is rarely used.
# "Data7" - The number of data bits in each character is 7. It is used for true ASCII. It generally only makes sense with older equipment such as teleprinters.
# "Data8" - The number of data bits in each character is 8. It is used for most kinds of data, as this size matches the size of a byte. It is almost universally used in newer applications.
